+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") locks +[Thomas Greanias](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902 "") out of the story....

It seems that, as +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "") had predicted in the letter discovered yesterday, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") is hoping to keep some of the secrets in her new work buried.

The leaked emails that I received indicate that both parties are at an impasse: Greanias hoping to develop (or perhaps, continue) a fully open flow of information from Hank to himself, and Hank refusing to shed further light on the incident that befell the Niantic Facility some months ago.

What I do know based on peripheral intel, is that both these individuals are headed to Seattle to attempt to intercept this document (which Felicia has dispatched by courier). Tom to uncover the story, Hank to keep it from the wrong hands.

**Those of you who've had a chance to get to know these two individuals might know that Tom allies himself with the Resistance ideology, and Hank Johnson with the Enlightenment. It leads to an interesting question. While they, and many other people in our world, are collaborators and friends, at what level do the philosophical differences break down to the point of ending the free flow of information? Is it possible for those who hold the values of the Resistance and those who share the vision of the Enlightened to truly collaborate? Or will there always be a threshold, a point beyond which camaraderie turns to mistrust?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, observations, references and speculation.
