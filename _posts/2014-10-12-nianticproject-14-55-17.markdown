Agents,

There are rumors that +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") had left a trail of breadcrumbs behind for himself prior to his [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion ""). The goal of these tiny fragments of information was to awaken and implant important memories that he knew would be lost in the process of his simulacrum re-forming.

It's likely that he found many of them, enough to come back to an understanding of the current state of the world and his role in it, but there are probably many more out there. Reports from Agents on the ground and +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") suggest that these lost breadcrumbs have begun to emerge into the Portal Network.

If you find any out in the field, please report back so that we can begin to assemble them and understand why Hank left these messages to himself.
