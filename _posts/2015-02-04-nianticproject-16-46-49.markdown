Another thread from today, P. A. Chapeau pointed out that we know very little about Jahan beyond what +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") has chosen to share with us...

Her past, her skillsets, her allegiances, all remain very much in the dark. We need to uncover more about her...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Jahan is giving me the hinks. What do we really know about her?  Hank Johnson just happens to get wounded at a temple located conveniently somewhere in Anywhere Town, India and presto, then she hustles Hank into finding the Shōnin Stone, whatever that is, and now she's jacked him onto some mystical summoning quest to his own grave in  Afghanistan. If that's creepy, I don't know what is?  Or am I being  a little harsh here?  Does she have some secret good motive that I'm unaware of?<br /><br /></div>
