When +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") was faced with a terrible sickness brought on by the changes in the Portal Network, Calvin executed an operation to treat him using Dark XM stolen from +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""). He had his own reasons, but, as we saw in leaked surveillance video of the treatment site, his methods worked.

Now, it seems the sickness has returned. Calvin had reached out to his contact at Hulong to obtain more Dark XM, ordering them to do so despite the greatly increased risk, but it may have all been for nothing.

Jarvis is refusing the treatment, and preparing to return the Ultimate once more. It's unclear exactly why he would choose this path, is it a moral stand against the Dark XM itself? Or, does he see something in our futures that he fears deeply... so deeply that he would sacrifice his hard earned body to return to the Portals and face the threat as an XM entity once more...
