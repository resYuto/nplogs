I came across this document. It's an internal file from the company known as Strategic Explorations. They were tracking Hank Johnson while he was seeking Sheba's mines during his recent Congo visit.

They made some interesting observations about the NIA using modded consumer products (in this case UP by Jawbone) to monitor XM levels and its physiological effects.

See the document on the Investigation Board at:Â [http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc512a](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc512a "")
