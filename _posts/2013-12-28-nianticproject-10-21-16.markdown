A report leaked from within +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") earlier today confirms reports that I've been hearing from Agents in the field: The Portal Network is experiencing some kind of destabilizing anomaly and Resonator and XMP construct outputs from Portal Hacks have been notably increased.

According to the report, Visur doesn't believe either of the other Corporations are responsible for the uptick, but that doesn't mean they might not be at the center of this.

**As competition between the three XM Corporations intensifies, I expect untraceable 'tests' and new forms of Exotic Matter technologies will become more common. Based on what we've seen before, and your predictions for the future, do you believe that each Corporation will specialize, focusing their research on particular kinds of Exotic Matter constructs and techniques?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
