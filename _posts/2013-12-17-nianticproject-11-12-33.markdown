What did +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â find and what has happened to him?

I was able to obtain the video first released via the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") livestream on Saturday. Hank Johnson's status remains unknown. I'm sure I share the concern of all Investigators, Enlightened or Resistance, for the safety of this charismatic, unique and well-respected XM Researcher.

**The simple answer to the above question is obvious, a ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** stronghold or sanctum of some kind, the harder question is: What does that mean? And where is it? In our discussion today of what might have happened to Hank, I would also encourage us to think of the consequences of 'the worst possible outcome.' What does Hank Johnson mean to the Enlightened and Resistance ideologies and Factions, and what would our path forward be without him? We should also consider the best possible outcome. If Hank returns to us unharmed, what knowledge might his adventure have bestowed on him, and how might we use it?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insight and references.
