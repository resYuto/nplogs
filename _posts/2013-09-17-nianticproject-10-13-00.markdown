Yesterday, we discussed ADA and her orchestration of the Niantic escape.

Today, a +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") leak reveals that ADA, despite lacking her former strength, remains committed to furthering her own agenda.

What also becomes clear, if you ask the right questions, is that Omnivore represents a clear and present threat to ADA. The only other time I've seen ADA make such a direct threat, Yuen Ni had ordered her processes terminated at the Niantic Facility in Geneva.

**I'm trying to figure out how this plays out. She has, if my understanding is correct, already been able to re-establish secondary instances of herself after the Niantic Shutdown. What might Omnivore's development state be if ADA is under such tremendous pressure to protect herself?**

A passcode, as always, to those who meaningfully contribute to our discussion.
