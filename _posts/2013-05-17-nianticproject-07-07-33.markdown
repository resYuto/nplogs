 [#anexoticmatter](https://plus.google.com/s/%23anexoticmatter "")     [#ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingress "")    <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Felicia Hajra-Lee</h2>My book is live in the Google Play Store.<br /><br />When I first started writing it, I believed that 'An Exotic Matter' was the strongest title, now that current events have caught up with what I believed to be a fiction, the publishers chose to change the name to the iconic 'The Niantic Project: Ingress'<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the read, and thank you to everyone for your support.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23anexoticmatter">#anexoticmatter</a><br /><br /></div>
