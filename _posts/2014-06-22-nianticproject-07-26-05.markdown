Congratulations to both Factions on a well-played Anomaly.  The Resistance capture Gettysburg and the  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")  Series with a sum total of R:14459.75 - E: 13656.75.<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Ingress</h2><br /><b>The Resistance capture the </b><b><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus">#Interitus</a></b><b> Anomaly Series.</b><br />Final Report<br /><br /><b>R:14459.75</b> - E: 13656.75<br /><br />Despite a dedicated push by Enlightened Agents, the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus">#Interitus</a> Series of Anomalies has been captured by the Resistance. <br /><br />By all indications, it seems ADA and Klue will succeed in using Resistance Fields to further their knowledgebase of  human behaviour, intelligence and creativity.

Final Report
R:14459.75 - E: 13656.75
Despite a dedicated push by Enlightened Agents, the #Interitus Series of Anomalies has been captured by the Resistance.
By all indications, it seems ADA and Klue will succeed in using Resistance Fields to further their knowledgebase of  human behaviour, intelligence and creativity. ADA seeks to use this knowledge to achieve the next phase in her evolution. It seems plausible that the bond between ADA and her human surrogate, Klue, will harden, and ADA’s already impressive capabilities of observation, detection and prediction will grow even more powerful.
