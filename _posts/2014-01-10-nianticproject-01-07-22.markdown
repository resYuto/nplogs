This week on the  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") , Susanna Moyer reports from an unknown location, admitting a former relationship with the NIA but denying any current allegiance to them.

Susanna discusses her meeting with Roland Jarvis in the wake of the 13MAGNUS 'rebirth' incident and her desire to uncover the truth behind his journey from Zurich to Cupid's Span.

She also presents updates on the ambiguous state of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")  following the release of a puzzling episode of Nomad during the closing moments of 13MAGNUS, and a similarly disturbing video of +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")  speaking with the voice of ADA.

In addition, Susanna explores how Ingress Agents worldwide have prepared themselves for the struggle in 2014, including cross-faction operations in Singapore and St. Petersburg, a massive Resistance field over the Pacific ocean and a united global new years message in the form of the  [#IngressNYE](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressNYE "")  photo-montage.

In Tech News, she covers the recent Portal-output Anomaly detected by +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") during the final days of 2013.
