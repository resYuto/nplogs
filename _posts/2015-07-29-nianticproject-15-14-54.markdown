An Investigator sent this to me, claiming to have found it somewhere within the Portal Network.Â 

No additional details were provided, so at this point I have no idea where this piece of intel was recovered.

It's possible that this material may be connected to the sensitive author, +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 ""), but again, without further information that is only speculation for now.

If this was written by Felicia, I am unsure how to process it. Is this a vision like much of her other work, or simple a piece of fiction? If it's a vision, does it portray the past, the present, or the future?

What do you think?
