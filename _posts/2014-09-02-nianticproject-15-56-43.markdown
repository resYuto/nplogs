+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), former Niantic Researcher and Shaper Glyph expert, ponders the true meaning of 'communication:' A meeting of minds and the transmission of pure, raw thought.

Yet another form uncovered during the course of the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifact Investigation has been decoded.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>Communication is a two part process. Without a recipient to take a shared message, to accept it, process it, comprehend it, the signal has no value. It is, in essence, null. It is like an unresolved waveform.<br /><br />I believe that these two Glyph forms, discovered in the course of the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios">#Helios</a>  Artifact investigations, represent the two components of communication: To send and receive, to call and respond. <br /><br />In the act of communication, the one who listens and acknowledges is an equal participant. The waveform does not travel from point A to point B, rather the sender and the receiver meet in the middle, outside of themselves yet connected by this shared experience.<br /><br />The sender and receiver together create the magic of thought transmission. In my opinion, this is the most powerful tool in the world, perhaps in the universe.<br /><br /></div>
