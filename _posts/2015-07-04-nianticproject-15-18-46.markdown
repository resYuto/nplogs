Did +[Paul School](https://plus.google.com/109763890472937053947 ""), +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s former colleague from her Arecibo days, actually sense a conversation between Devra and +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), or is he imagining things?

At some level, it's worth considering what might happen now that both these fractured personalities have become united, both with the fragments of themselves and with each other inside the Portal Network.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Paul School</h2>I meditate, or at-least I try to.<br /><br />I find it's a useful exercise, to try and reorder the events of the past and find perspective.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm not very good at it. Some nights, I just sit there, eyes closed, feeling like a fool. Occasionally though, the voice of my own thinking goes silent, and I get pulled in by the sounds of the outside.Â <br /><br />Tonight was one of those nights. In the quiet, I heard two voices speaking. Devra, I recognized instantly. Her voice is so distinct, so confident and powerful. I would know it anywhere. The other was less clear, but I knew that voice too. I think it was Lightman.<br /><br />I couldn't hear their words, but they were deep in conversation. I don't believe they were actually present, I suspect that I sensed something happening... well, not here.<br /><br />I don't know what this means. Perhaps that's why I'll try and find in tomorrow's meditation.<br /><br /></div>
