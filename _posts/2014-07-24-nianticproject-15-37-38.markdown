The current Shaper Septicycle began with an aggressive push by Agents around the globe to counter +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s Portal Virus by raising the Global MU Level above 700 Million Mind Units.

Devra was quick to respond.

Is this a genuine warning of what's to come, or is she feeling backed into a corner?
