Thanks to whoever sent this, we bailed out of Mirror Lake just in time. +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") is en-route to Portland, said 'something incredibly important' had come up, and she needed to get there by Sunday. Obviously, we have to be careful about how and when we communicate. Please update me with any relevant information.
