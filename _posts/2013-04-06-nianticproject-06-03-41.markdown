A recent transcript of a conversation between Misty Hannah and ADA. Keep an ear to the ground, I'll share details about this public performance as soon as I hear more. 

With Phillips being given more or less carte-blanche to 'clean house,' and Misty apparently having some old scores of her own out in the wild, it's clear to me why Misty needs ADA. 

Not sure yet how exactly ADA hopes to exploit Misty's knowledge of Exotic Matter Hyperthreading to her own advantage. If you have a theory, let me know. 

See it on the Investigation Board at [http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc505a](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc505a "")
