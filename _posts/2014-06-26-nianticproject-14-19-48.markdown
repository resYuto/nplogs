**"The Enlightenment as we knew it is over,"** +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") proclaims.

The pages, discovered by Resistance agents in Krakow this weekend have been revealed to the public in full: [https://goo.gl/ekOh9Z](https://goo.gl/ekOh9Z "")

I sense that Jarvis was most disturbed by what he saw in them...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Roland Jarvis</h2>Those of you that have failed to embrace the teachings of our Friends and instead allowed the machine/human hybrid to grow do not fully understand what you've done. <br /><br />By rejecting our friends, you have opened the door for an unspeakable evil. One that will blanket our world in a fog of decay.<br /><br />The Enlightenment as we knew it is over. The awakening dragon shall devour us all. <br /><br /></div>
