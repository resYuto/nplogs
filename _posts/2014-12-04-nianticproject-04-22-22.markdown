A cryptic message from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") ponders epiphanies... destiny... the force that seems to have driven him to this moment in time.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>It is interesting to note that almost any flash of inspiration, epiphany, if you will, seems suDdenly Obvious oNce yOu have had the epiphany.  IT iS only now that I rEalize that whEn I set out on my journey, after the recursion, that I had no idea exactly what I was looKing for.  I was led, at first, by breadcrumbs that I dropped, but after that, it felt that I was led by soME force whose name I do not know… Destiny?  EnlighteneD chancE?  Path of Least resIstanCe?  I could Argue for any of ThEse…  Whatever it was, I feel like I was guided here.  And I am not one who Believes in predestination.  In truth, I do not, by nAture, beLieve in unseen (occult if you will) forces.  And yet… And yet… I have no better explANation for the apparently ChancE events which led me to where I am now. For I know I am in the place I was destined for. Or am I with the person I was destined for?  Or am I in a time I was destined for?  Or is it simply a state of mind. Words drift through my mind… Sansara… Darsana…<br /><br /></div>
