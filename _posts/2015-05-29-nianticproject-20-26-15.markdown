According to a source who wished to remain anonymous, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") reached out to a small cadre of agents to seek their help in retrieving the envelope given to him by Nigel Moyer. 

It is not currently known what these Agents intend to do with the envelope once it is in their possession. Will they keep it sealed and give it to +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") as her father had intended? Or will they open it, to see what lies within...

According to the source, the handoff is happening at 1600 EDT on Friday in a small park in Arlington. A mission will go online at 1500 EDT, containing instructions guiding the Agents to the handoff site. According to the source, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") included this image as a clue in his message to the Agents.
