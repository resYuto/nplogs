**URGENT ALERT TO ALL INVESTIGATORS**

**BODY OF HANK JOHNSON DISCOVERED**

A lost camera from the filming of Hank Johnson's NOMAD -  [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")  episode was recently recovered at a night bazaar in Karachi.

The finder claims to have received a large wire transfer in exchange for 'destroying the SD card.'

I've obtained a copy of the footage. I expect ADA obtained a replica of the data on the card before ordering its destruction.

The person in Karachi promised that it 'had to be seen to be believed.' 

I'm afraid to say he's right.

Reportedly, Klue showed this video to players at the  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Anomaly in Nashville today. 

Her words to them: "Enlightened Agents, give up the pursuit of the Artifacts. **Hank Johnson is dead...**"
