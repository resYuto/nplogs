+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â breaks his silence, and it seems Agents in Phoenix, Arizona may need to answer the Nomad's call.

The former Niantic Project Investigator remains on the tail of the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") mystery, and if the past is anything to go by, there will be more to come as he works his way through this.

**"Anomalies create us, and we create Anomalies." Cryptic words. What's your interpretation of this? What are Exotic Matter Anomalies, and what is their relationship to us as Agents and Sensitives? How might Anomalies have impacted us in the past, and what does that mean for our future?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
