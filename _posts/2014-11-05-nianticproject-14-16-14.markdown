*"I do believe that some of what we see is not real... is disguised.  Or maybe our reality is the disguise."*

I believe that power-spots (Portals) have sensing capabilities, intelligence and memory. Maybe that is well known to others. While the definition of ‘life’ is heavily disputed, I would almost go so far as to say they are alive. While the hallucinations/dreams (which I suspect are really time shifts) are rare, they have not left. Now and again, I will peer into the past or perhaps the future for an instant before snapping back into reality.  Occasionally, I will see other beings in place of humans...  I can not tell whether this is real. There can be a lot of interpretations of this phenomenon. However, I do believe that some of what we see is not real... is disguised.  Or maybe our reality is the disguise.", "<br />", "<br />"], :ignore=>true}}
