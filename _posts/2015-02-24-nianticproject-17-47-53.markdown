She calls herself his Acolyte. 

Practically nothing is known about her, not even her name. She claims that +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") is dead, and that she intends to carry the light of the Enlightened movement forward.

Will she be able to guide those seeking knowledge of the Ultimate? It's too soon to tell, but I detect a powerful resolve behind her eyes.
