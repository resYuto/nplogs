A new discovery near Stonehenge inspires +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â to present a theory for its origin.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I saw this, and the word 'lens' immediately popped into my mind (an epiphany? Maybe. Of course, there's no way to be certain...)<br /><br />Why the word 'lens?'<br /><br />It occurs to me that a Portal is a kind of lens. It focuses and enhances the well-being, creativity and mental state of those near it, and it perhaps serves to lens the extra-dimensional wormholes emerging into our world as well.<br /><br />A site like this would have been the result of ancient Sensitives beginning to feel the power of the Portals and slowly learning how to enhance them. Just like a lens, when it is coarse, it can only focus so much light: It takes a massive amount of grinding and polishing to maximize its potential. (It's possible that, over time, we've learned how to focus our creativity to create more powerful Portals.)<br /><br />Perhaps the ancients were just beginning to sense that they could focus the potential contained within the Portals near them... or perhaps they sensed that they could slowly begin to create the enhancing experience of a Portal by 'lensing' their environment?<br /><br />Could that explain sites like this? What do you think?<br /><br /></div>
