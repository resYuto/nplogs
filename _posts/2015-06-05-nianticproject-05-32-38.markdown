From Washington DC, +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports on the first day of [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomalies, which swept across Bratislava, Bari, Covilhã and Thessaloniki followed by Washington DC, Buenos Aires, Phoenix and Toronto. In a day marked with fierce competition between the thousands of Agents on the ground, the Resistance and Enlightened each emerged with a victory in hand. However, with the struggle for the [#LightmanShards](https://plus.google.com/s/%23LightmanShards "") entering a second phase following the Target Portals reversing alignment, much remains to unfold before [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") comes to a close.

In DC, Agents participated in +[GORUCK HQ](https://plus.google.com/105041353271604909960 "") Spec-Ops Training exercises to earn Volatile Portal intel for their Factions and in Bratislava, Agents took part in an Ingress [#MissionDay](https://plus.google.com/s/%23MissionDay ""), exploring the deep and rich history of the Slovakian capital.

Agents in Washington, DC also engaged in a special mission for Hank Johnson to obtain a sensitive packet of information from a contact at +[DARPA](https://plus.google.com/106895702434703841845 "") and securely shuttle it to Susanna Moyer. The task to uncover its meaning now begins.

The next [#IngressFS](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressFS "") First Saturday is just around the corner, on June 6. Find one near you at [https://www.ingress.com/events](https://www.ingress.com/events "")
