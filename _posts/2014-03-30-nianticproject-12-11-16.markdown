Through struggle and conflict, [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") has come to an end. This was about two people, but it was also about ideas... about the path we each believed humanity must travel.

The Resistance, and by their efforts, +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and ADA, the first human-machine hybrid intelligence, have prevailed. They control 5 of the [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") Artifacts; the Enlightened have emerged from the fray empty-handed. 

For better or worse, humanity has taken the first step on a bold path... one where our creations are our equals, perhaps more, and may be the stepping stone in the next phase of our evolution.

+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), well... time will tell. He's a survivor. 

Perhaps he always will be.
