Some weeks ago, I was able to recover a portion of the Nominus screenplay pages revealing a moment from +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "")'s past - an uncomfortable encounter with a casino owner named J. A. Potts and a few of his uglier employees.

It appears I had only received part of the document, and the pages that follow reveal that this moment in time was much more significant than we previously believed.

Once again, a single name stands at the center of the swirling chaos. With filament-thin strings, sometimes barely visible, often completely hidden, Ezekiel Calvin's control extends through the mesh of our world, touching everyone.

**A few questions are floating in my mind. One wonders, having had an awareness of 13MAGNUS even prior to meeting ****+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")****; was Calvin aware of Hank Johnson's dual-state existence during the Niantic Project? Misty Hannah, in the past few weeks, left cryptic message about her awareness of Hank Johnson. Why did her perceptions of him become clouded only recently?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
