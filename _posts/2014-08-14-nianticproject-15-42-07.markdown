The [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts emerge, bringing with them new mysteries and new Shaper Glyphs.

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") has begun his investigation into these new forms, and seeks the help of the investigative community.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>The research into the emerging  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios">#Helios</a>  Artifacts has begun to reveal new Glyphs.<br /><br />As of now, the work to uncover their meaning is only beginning - I am choosing to focus on one at a time.<br /><br />This form clearly includes the Glyph for 'Clear' and may also evoke the Glyphs for 'Past.' as well as for 'Portal.'<br /><br />I cannot do this work alone. This is an abstract puzzle of the mind: Our  sensations and feelings guide us, our instinctual response slowly sheds light on the path to knowledge.<br /><br />I will need your help as this process continues. I look forward to your interpretation of this Glyph, the first of many to come.<br /><br /></div>
