An update from +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") -- she's deep in pursuit of some intel related to [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon ""). I've heard rumors they may be connected to the so called 'Flash Shard' Anomalies, but cannot confirm that at this time.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Susanna Moyer</h2>I've been chasing down a lead about <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a>.<br /><br />The intel is solid... worth pursuing.<br /><br />Expect an  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport">#IngressReport</a>  on Friday this week. <br /><br />I hope I'll be back in time, but if not, perhaps one of my fellow Investigators will help out.<br /><br />Stay tuned.<br /><br /></div>
[#### photo: I've been chasing down a lead about #Abaddon.
The intel is solid... worth pursuing.
Expect an #IngressReport  on Friday this week.
I hope I'll be back in time, but if not, perhaps one of my fellow Investigators will help out.
Stay tuned.](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IIhZVRWBtBk/VgN71_X5y-I/AAAAAAAAAbI/TKEshvvLVb8/w800-h430/Report.png "")
