The first decisive move in the struggle to capture and activate the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts has been made.

Earlier today, Resistance Agents captured both Artifact 03 and Artifact 04 within the Target Portal aligned to them on the southern coast of Spain. After falling behind at the last [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomalies centered around Taipei and Chicago, it seems the Resistance is determined to stay in the fight: The Artifacts will surely play a central role in that.

The remaining three Artifacts from the first group of five are poised to fly in Fiji and Hawaii... A single clear shot across the Pacific Ocean, and the Enlightened will have them all at their Target Portal in Peru.

In the meantime, Agents have already begun to prepare for the arrival of the second group. The next ten Artifacts are expected to emerge on or around the 20th of August. At that time, the Target Portals aligned to the Resistance and the Enlightened will also destabilize and reappear at new locations.

One thing is for certain, with fourty Artifacts set to emerge over the course of the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomalies, this struggle is only beginning.
