*"I stuck my head out, and saw something chilling... I saw myself running... AK blazing. It felt like neither memory nor hallucination, but as if I was watching live events in another time..."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Inside the cave -- a small one, about the size of my storage locker in Tyson’s Corners or my freshman dorm room, I found a backpack.<br /><br />Side arm. MREs. Sleeping bag. I’d left it for myself.<br /><br />And there was a note, too... from me. The message was simple. (In retrospect, not simple at all, but I think I read the first line and took it to heart. The rest would have be studied in detail later.)<br /><br />A chopper augered in and exploded not far away. That would draw people with guns and unknown intentions. <br /><br />I had to take my own advice to heart and keep moving...<br /><br />I stuck my head out, and saw something chilling... I saw myself running... AK blazing. It felt like neither memory nor hallucination, but as if I was watching live events in another time... The terrain blurred and the image was gone.<br /><br />Curiously, as bizarre as these events are to recount, they did not seem strange to me at the time.  Does this mean that I am or was … shaped? Trapped in some kind of XM induced dream?<br /><br /></div>
