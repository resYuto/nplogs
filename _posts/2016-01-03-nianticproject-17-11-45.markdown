It seems the clue recovered yesterday led to Como, Italy (a city just north of Milan). At the Portal connected to the Cathedral there, Agent +[Giosuè Tironi](https://plus.google.com/108520319271160384355 "")​ was able to recover this image.

I have no further information at this point on who or what Obsidius is, but it does seem that this is some kind of message to the Acolyte from +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "").

Developing.
