The next [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") Anomaly approaches. Will +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") find what he's looking for?

All eyes turn to the sites of the Primary Anomalies, Phoenix and Rome, and the secondary vectors in Athens, Istanbul, Tucson and Nashville. Each of these locations will be at the heart of conflict with global implications tomorrow. The Faction that controls the majority of the sites, or failing that, the Anomaly overall, may impact the manifestation of the final Shard in [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS ""), the last fragment of XM Entity Roland Jarvis.

But there's more at stake, it seems. Hank Johnson, ever in pursuit of that half-imagined, half true thing called myth, believes that the final clue leading him to uncover the secret behind [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS ""), the Osiris Myth and its current day counterpart may be uncovered as well.

**Hank believes that ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** may have generated pursuers. I wonder if the evidence before us supports that theory, not only with the pieces that have assembled at the periphery, such as Nigel Moyer, Dreizehn Große and more, but with those at the center, Oliver Lynton-Wolfe and Roland Jarvis. If the pursuers catch up, will they erase the evidence, as they apparently did in Arecibo? Where will that leave those trapped in the flux of these events? Where will that leave us?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.

[#### photo: I’ve been out finishing NOMAD. It’s the best way I know to share the truth about #13MAGNUS.
Production is going well and I thank Dr. Schubert for all of his help.
Disappointingly, I returned to what I believed to be the cave site Devra and I had visited at Arecibo, but could not find the Glyphs again, either there or in the old Spanish church.  It leads me to believe that #13MAGNUS might also beget pursuers. I have no proof of their existence, but have a strong suspicion.  I believe everything will rest on being able to find the ‘nest.’  Some texts I have encountered refer to it as a Necropolis or what is referred to in early Apocripha as a Locus Expectans (place of waiting).
Presumably, that is the place where XM infused vessels are stored.
I am searching for a map that I believe circled the world, passing from hand to hand in the possession of missionaries, before finally ending up in Vatican control. The true significance of this map, I believe, has been long misunderstood.
I had expected that it had been destroyed, but now I believe still exists.
It is my hope that by leveraging the power of this Anomaly, in addition to influencing the location where the 13th Shard will manifest, we may be able to uncover this critical document.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-I6xJk5Cm-Ww/UqKd7_mGJ5I/AAAAAAAAAYg/vwsha0JPj68/w1200-h1714/Expectans.png "")
