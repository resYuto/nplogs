Agents from across the world assisted in gathering and assembling a series of scattered fragments. I am grateful for their efforts.

Combined, the fragments revealed this intimate conversation between +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") and an unknown acolyte.

Their conversation reveals Jarvis's view of the universe in a manner that is surprising, and perhaps troublesome. It sheds light on the reasons Jarvis and those who follow him have so stridently opposed ADA and development of Artificial Intelligences in general.

I wonder if the universe is truly as brittle as Jarvis believes. If it is, I can understand his cause for concern.
