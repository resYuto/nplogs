And finally, +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "") shared an ancient, cryptic poem sent to him by some anonymous, academic source...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Yuri Alaric Nagassa</h2>I put out an academic call and this came anonymously. I have no idea why whoever sent it wouldn't attach their name to it.  This is more Stein's territory than mine, but apparently it has to do with a mythical mountain and the Shōnin stone.  For what its worth, the first thing that came to mind was my journey to the Valley of the Dead in that this is quite obviously about some place that allegedly doesn't exist.<br /><br />May Indra, whose hands Thunder wield,<br />Be in the East thy guard and shield;<br />May Yama's care the South befriend,<br />And Varun's arm the West defend;<br />And let Kuvera, the Lord of gold,<br />The North with firm protection hold!<br /><br /></div>
