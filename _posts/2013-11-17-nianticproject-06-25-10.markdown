The gaps widen, with the Enlightened surging ahead in Houston thanks to their massive overhead fields, and the Resistance continuing to exploit the Ground tactics in Austin and San Antonio.

In Dallas, however, despite another Resistance field surviving the Measurement window, the distance between the Factions is small enough to be overcome by the Global MU shift. The situation for either Faction there remains precarious.
