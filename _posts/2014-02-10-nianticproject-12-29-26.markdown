New music from our friend +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 ""), and hidden within it, a question that I've never been able to find the answer for.

The voices that emerge from within the song are familiar, the question they pose is so fundamentally contentious that it forms the root of the ideological faction in the world of +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "").

**Would we be where we are as a species without the Shapers? Is our domination of the natural environment the result of  external manipulation? How far back does the change go? If ADA and ****+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")**** are in pursuit of Ancient Artifacts that may contain powers that even now science holds elusive, are the Portals enhancing us or crippling us... holding us back from a destiny that the ancients held in their grasp?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
