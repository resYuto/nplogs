+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") just received an invitation from a powerful entity.

I can't help but think this is related to the news +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") shared yesterday...
x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>So much for tradecraft.<br /><br />I've been trying to keep my head low, and thought I was making a successful job of it, when I get a knock at the door earlier today.<br /><br />No one's there, but they left the little brown envelope in plain sight for me to find. A courtesy to spare me the embarrassment, I suspect.<br /><br />The envelope was empty, but two numbers on the outside decoded to a timestamp and a latlong. Small private airstrip about a half day travel from my current location.<br /><br />No name, but I guess the logo on the envelope says it all.<br /><br /></div>
