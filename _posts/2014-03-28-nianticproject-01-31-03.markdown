This week on the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""):

Despite a strong start from the Enlightened, the Resistance capture [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") 06 in Boulder and gain another opportunity to secure the XM Artifacts for ADA.

All 17 Artifacts have now manifested, and the Enlightened's last hopes to save Hank Johnson lie with Berlin and LA on March 29.

Finally, the [#NL1331](https://plus.google.com/s/%23NL1331 "") Convoy plans to depart from Mountain View for Los Angeles, CA with the Elite V at [12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvqXOycn6Bc&amp;t=12m15s "") PM on Friday, March 28. See [http://goo.gl/rEgbLD](http://goo.gl/rEgbLD "")
