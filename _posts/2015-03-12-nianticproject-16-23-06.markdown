+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") recovers an old NIA document, from the era before the launch of the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 ""), that discusses a program called Truthseeker. 

It seems +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") (also known as P. A. Chapeau) may have built something called Truthseeker before he joined the Niantic Project to help tune +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 ""). 

If you read between the lines, the real question emerges: Was Truthseeker a component that went into creating ADA? If so, what are the implications of that? What is Truthseeker?
