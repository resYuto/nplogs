Was Katalena a test of some kind?

Another transcript emerges from Brandt's investigation, revealing more secrets behind the second body at Zurich. The transcript scratches the surface of a relationship that seems to be significantly more complex than what we previously understood.

**What do you think the nature of ADA's relationship with Katalena was? ADA's pathway into this relationship seems methodical, and if I had to take a guess, there's much more here that we've yet to discover. What were ADA's motivations in establishing such a lengthy relationship with someone who we previously assumed was merely collateral damage?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
