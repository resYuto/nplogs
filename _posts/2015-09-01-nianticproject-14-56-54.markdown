+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") focuses in on the next piece in the puzzle that lies at the heart of [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "").

What did the Researchers who disappeared during Shōnin have in common?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>This is the next piece in the puzzle.<br /><br />When Jahan attempted to use the Shōnin Stone at the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan, a massive XM explosion happened. <br /><br />In that moment, people who had been connected to the Niantic Project disappeared.<br /><br />But only some of them... Hank Johnson didn't. PAC and Bowles didn't. Jarvis, well we're not sure about him, or Kureze or Carrie.<br /><br />But Devra and Lightman certainly did. And if Hank's investigation is anything to go by, Schubert, Nagassa, Lynton-Wolfe and Calvin did too.<br /><br />So, what do they all have in common? Why them and not the others?<br /><br /></div>
