+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") shares his hopes and fears about the  [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "")  Artifacts.

Within them he sees tremendous power: A revelation into the nature of the universe so powerful that it would begin a new era in our collective journey through reality.

And yet, as Jarvis warned him, to know is a one way journey. As we gain knowledge, we begin to lose our innocence.
