Agents and Investigators helped guide +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") towards a decision. 

Let's hope the wisdom of the crowd pays off for him.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Thanks for sharing your opinions. Your advice was valuable. <br /><br />I landed near Munich a few hours ago. I'll go see what Ilya has to say for himself, then I'm back stateside. I don't intend to stay here long, but Ilya is a powerful man, and I try not to burn bridges if I don't have to.<br /><br />I'll check in on the other side of this.<br /><br /></div>
