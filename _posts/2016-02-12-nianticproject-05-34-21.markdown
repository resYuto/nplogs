New [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""). A look back at the Anomalies and Agent activities that inspired us with their scale and ambition in 2015.

Susanna reviews the Shard and Ground Operations during the Sh≈çnin, Persepolis and Abaddon Anomalies. Over 100,000 Agents from around the world attended tightly contested ground battles and took part in globe-uniting Shard Operations to gain control of the Niantic Researchers. In addition, Agents took part in nearly 700 First Saturdays, 40 Mission Days, and launched massive ops of their own, including Unight16, Buddha, Midgard, Blue Cedar and more. Agents, use the comment section to share your favorite sitreps from 2015.

Don't miss this incredible review of a year filled with adventure and camaraderie, and be sure to subscribe to the Ingress Youtube channel to maximize your Agent experience.
