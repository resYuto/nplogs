Stein Lightman shares a riddle that's emerged from his research into the  [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "")  Artifacts.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>This has been one of the most challenging Glyphs to emerge from the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios">#Helios</a>  Artifacts.<br /><br />Here's a hint. Compare this to the Glyph for Perfection/Balance.<br /><br />It seems to represent an opposite, and yet, the opposite of Perfection would be Chaos, a sharp, imbalanced form. Jagged and fear-inducing.<br /><br />This one, on the other hand, seems fragile. Symmetrical and pleasing, but delicately, perhaps preciously balanced. Something that could easily lose its perfect position and shatter if disturbed.<br /><br />It's a riddle.<br /><br />It is imperfect, but beautiful. Imbalanced but fragile, and perhaps worth protecting.<br /><br />I think I've figured it out. Can you?<br /><br /></div>
