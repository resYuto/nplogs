An update to the Ingress Scanner Technology has brought the Powercubes out into the open. 

I've had this document for quite some time, but I was never quite sure of its veracity. As things have unfolded it seems it was a real piece of intel.

Both factions are beginning to absorb the news revealed yesterday ( [http://goo.gl/4eYC9](http://goo.gl/4eYC9 "") ), of a data exfil operation on April 21 covering a sizeable section of Europe. The powercubes, with their tactical value in high-XM use situations, will undoubtedly be a powerful tool during this mission.
