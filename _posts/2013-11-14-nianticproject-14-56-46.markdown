After working on the track for nearly a year, enoch dalby has released the piece of music he began to discover on the night of Oliver Lynton-Wolfe's failed Powercube experiment at the Niantic Project Facility in Geneva, Switzerland.Â 

On that night, Exotic Matter flooded the lab, causing each of the researchers' full creative and intellectual potential to be unlocked. The visions and ideas that emerged that night have fueled the development of the world of Ingress.

During the chaos of the XM overload, Devra Bogdanovich, disheartened by the Project's blatant disregard for public safety, fled into the night with Enlightened sculptor Roland Jarvis. Assisted by ADA, the project's sentient Artificial Intelligence, she escaped into Europe to seek an XM lab without the overbearing control of the NIA. Roland Jarvis traveled separately to Zurich, and met his bloody fate at the hands of NIA Agents.

**What's interesting to me, is that I always imagined Epiphany Night would be a lyrical, magical, poetic piece of music. It turns out it's at times claustrophobic, dark and imposing. The visuals enoch has chosen to pair with the music seems significant as well, beginning with the moment of the Hypercube XM release, and ending with Jarvis's death. Listening to the music and watching the video he's prepared, I am led to speculate regarding the man's factional alliance. Is he mourning Jarvis, or the XM?**

A passcode to those who enrich our discussion with speculation, references and insights.

Ideas, patterns, sounds.<br /><br />I've been processing that singular moment since.<br /><br />I present: <b>Epiphany Night</b>.<br /><br />I'll be uploading this to my Soundcloud account in the next few days.<br /><br /></div>
