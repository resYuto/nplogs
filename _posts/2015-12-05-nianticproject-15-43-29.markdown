+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares an update from South America before he begins his journey north -- toward the ‪#‎Abaddon‬ Anomaly in Oakland.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>It's common knowledge now that I was/am involved in an operation with Jahan in South America. (obfuscating for security reasons)<br /><br />I'm not going to say much about it -- there's obvious opportunity for blowback. The opposition tied to this particular op is/was of an extremely unsavory strain. I don't mind getting my hands dirty, but... this is not something I enjoy.<br /><br />As for the intel leak from a few days ago. Trust me, the corporate types are the least of my worries right now.<br /><br />In the coming week, I'm going to be making my way north. Headed to the Bay Area. Oakland.<br /><br />Some investigators have been probing the connections between <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a> and Josiah Harlan’s ill-fated journey from Afghanistan to San Francisco - the final resting place of the original Niantic ship after leaving Payta in Peru.<br /><br />It's possible (maybe even likely) that the Niantic was carrying a Prime Artifact, and Harlan was chasing after it. <br /><br />There are, in fact, theories that the Niantic may have been carrying a fragment of 'The Original' XM Artifact, with a history that goes back to the stone age.<br /><br />Anyway. It's all smoke and mirrors until I've got proof in hand. Can’t say more right now.<br /><br />If you're going to be in Oakland during the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a> Anomaly, come see me.<br /><br /></div>
