At some point (I believe recently), +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") gave a brief talk on his work at Niantic.

A recording of this talk has made it's way to me, this is the first portion of that talk. 

It's offers fascinating insight into the man now responsible for the trunk of our knowledge about Shaper Glyphs and their possible interpretations.

**Rumors have often circulated that Stein Lightman may in fact be a fraud, or some kind of huckster. It's interesting to hear him address the issue, if perhaps not comprehensively. In addition, he floats some rather... spectacular theories... Talking to animals? Other interesting ideas as well.... What does hearing this talk bring to mind for you? Does it cause you to distrust him, or do you believe that what he's saying might hold some truth? I look forward to hearing your thoughts.**

A passcode, as always, to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, memories and speculation.
