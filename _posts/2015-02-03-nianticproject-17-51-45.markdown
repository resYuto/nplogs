After some days of silence, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares a moment between Azmati and Jahan... Antimagnus and 13MAGNUS... Those aligned with the N'zeer, and those aligned with the Shapers. Hank is trapped in the middle of a conflict that has spanned millenia. 

I wonder what it might mean if Jahan was right.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Very interesting conversation between Jahan and Azmati, yesterday.  He asked her what she thought was going to happen at the 13MAGNUS Nest. She said that the duality must be restored. That life has been out of balance on the planet ever since the banishment.  He scoffed at that.  For a minute, I thought they had history.  <br /><br />One thing I did discover. Jahan may have once been a student of Devra’s.  Interesting but not sure what to make of it.<br /><br />In any case, it seems that she is dead set on going ahead even though she is not clear on the exact outcome.  I, of course, was at a loss for much of the conversation. They have been steeped in the battle between 13MAGNUS and Anti-Magnus, and by extension, the battle between the Shapers and the N’zeer. For them, it has been a central feature of their life. For me, it was an academic pursuit that I was drawn into.  <br /><br />Only now, it’s become so much more.  Will try to share again later.<br /><br />We’re on the move.<br /><br /></div>
