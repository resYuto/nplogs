+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") prepares to shoot another episode of NOMAD, this time focusing on a mystery that lies at the heart of [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "").

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Back in pre-production for Nomad again. It's been a long time. Seems like forever ago that I was shooting in the Congo (<a href="https://goo.gl/lE7Ss5" class="ot-anchor">https://goo.gl/lE7Ss5</a>) or at Cross Plains (<a href="https://goo.gl/HGusUf" class="ot-anchor">https://goo.gl/HGusUf</a>) or near the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan (<a href="https://goo.gl/EqoDcL" class="ot-anchor">https://goo.gl/EqoDcL</a>).  <br /><br />I want what I have to impart to go out wide so that if something happens to me, others will be able to follow. Looking back, I feel like I've done one of these before almost every major journey. I think of Nomad as like a file in an investigation: A place to archive ideas, instincts and discoveries. <br /><br />I'll give you one hint as to what's coming. Her name was Thaïs.  She was called the Harlot, the Courtesan and other things. Is that what she really was, or is that a 2,000 year old cover story for an operation that is playing out today? You be the judge.<br /><br /></div>
