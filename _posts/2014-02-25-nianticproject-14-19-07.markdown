*****BREAKING*****

PAC's profile just went live again after an extended period of silence.

Working to confirm this is really him and not an infiltration of his dormant account.

No word directly from him to me and by the time I noticed he was already offline again. 

*****DEVELOPING... STAND BY*****

**Update 1:**

If you aren't familiar with P. A. Chapeau, he is in fact the reason this investigation exists.

Back in November 2012, PA created a site called [nianticproject.com](http://nianticproject.com/ "") to monitor leaks emerging related to +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 ""), +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 ""), and Exotic Matter.

We later learned that he was in fact +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 ""), a contractor hired by Niantic to assist in the development of ADA, particularly in her 'humanization' process.

After a long struggle with the fallout from his investigation, particularly the death of +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") and a falling out with +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") , and on the advice of +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 ""), he decided to go off the grid. He was attempting to disconnect himself from the investigation and our world in order to regain his sense of well-being.

This was in October. He handed the reigns of the Investigation to me and then disappeared. 

This was his last message, posted on the now dormant Investigation Board: [http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=scx0](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=scx0 "")

We haven't heard from him since, until today...

**Update 2:**

An encoded message was embedded in the two photos uploaded to the profile:

**I need to see you. I have a friend who will give you my coordinates. Please come see me. We need to talk about everything that’s happened, and where we go from here. I miss you. Please come.**

We believe this message was directed at +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")...

She responded on his G+ Profile post, also in code, as follows:

**I understand. See you soon.**

Based on this, it seems likely that +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") will attempt to communicate with +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")'s contact in Nashville during the Anomaly on Saturday....
