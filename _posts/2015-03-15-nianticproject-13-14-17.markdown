Any readers of history among us?

+[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") recovers an introductory fragment to a book by +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") about Alexander the Great.

Was Alexander Enlightened and a member of 13MAGNUS? Schubert seems to think so...
