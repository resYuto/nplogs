A 13,000 year old historical artifact covered in geometric codes piques +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s curiosity and interest.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>An incredible finding. Both astounding and totally unsurprising.<br /><br />What does this mystery mean? I'm not sure but at 13,000 years old, it's a fascinating artifact and a glimpse into the power inspiration held even when we were such a young species.<br /><br />As for the codes covering it? They look pretty familiar to me...<br /><br /></div>
