The last 3 years have been a flurry of activity in the world of +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") , with the birth of new communities, new friendships, remarkable acts of creativity and epic adventures on foot with others.

At a press conference in Japan, Niantic's CEO, +[John Hanke](https://plus.google.com/106327138010385230607 ""), along with gaming giants Mr. Ishihara of The Pokemon Company, Mr. Masuda of Game Freak and Mr. Miyamoto of Nintendo, announced the beginning of a bold new adventure: Pokemon GO, which will emerge in early 2016. A closed beta will take place this winter.

Meanwhile, new details have emerged about the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomaly series, which will take place on October 10th and 24th, as well as November 14th and December 12th. (See detailed listing below). After failing to activate a 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan, Jahan caused an XM event that echoed across the globe, causing every known Niantic Project researcher to disappear. Their fates lie at the heart of the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomalies.

Agents around the world continue to impress and inspire with their incredible operations. Sitreps from Utah, India, Uruguay, Japan, Indiana, Virginia, Ukraine, Italy, Sri Lanka and Ireland are featured.

+[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 ""), the Agent-run and Agent-focused Youtube show has launched a Chinese version of the show, and +[Andrew Krug](https://plus.google.com/104577088576326284308 ""), a host of Behind the Scanner, has released a new video that attempts to cover the events of the nearly 3-year long Niantic Investigation.
