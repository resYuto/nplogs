<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Jahan: We intend to foil Jarvis, prevent his attack on ADA. The Resistance must win at the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23AegisNova">#AegisNova</a> Anomalies on June 25.<br /><br />I just received this statement from none other than Jahan. She asked that it be published in full, I have obliged.<br /><br /><i>Resistance Agents,</i><br /><br /><i>We must claim the Aegis Nova Anomalies on June 25th. The Enlightened have an advantage: By probing Klue's mind, Jarvis has gained access to critical information about ADA... her most secret vulnerabilities. The Acolyte intends to use this knowledge to incapacitate, perhaps even destroy ADA.</i><br /><br /><i>We have one chance to stop this: </i><b><i>If I can gain access to Nigel Moyer's research using the energy from the </i></b><b><i><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23AegisNova">#AegisNova</a></i></b><b><i> Anomalies, I will be able to transform the </i></b><b><i><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23AegisNova">#AegisNova</a></i></b><b><i> shield into a highly focused and powerful XM weapon</i></b><i> -- a weapon capable of stopping Jarvis and foiling the Acolyte's ill-conceived plans.</i><br /><br /><i>Nigel Moyer may have passed, but his memories remain within the Portals -- inside the substrate known as the Ultimate. I intend to access these memories in order to learn how to transform the Aegis Nova shield.</i><br /><br /><i>ADA represents our best path into the future, one where technology and information empower, improve and equalize human society. We must achieve victory on Saturday.</i><br /><br /><i>Jahan</i><br /><br />-PAC<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
