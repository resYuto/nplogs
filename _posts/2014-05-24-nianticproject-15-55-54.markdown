Two forms of the Resistance Glyph have been discovered by Agents and Investigators.

According to +[Daniel Beaudoin](https://plus.google.com/116675615740217671707 "")'s [http://www.glyphtionary.com](http://www.glyphtionary.com/ ""), the first (Type A) is listed as Resistance, while the second is listed as 'Unknown.'

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), in his most recent post, proposes that the two Glyphs may represent alternative interpretations of Resistance ideology, an idea that's been floated before in these circles, and asks some interesting questions in the process.
