Dr. +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "") responds to +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")'s post from yesterday with a parable from his childhood.

There seems to be a common thread: Loss and Rediscovery. The true nature of being. Secrets.

Although we had considered the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") cycle at an end with the return of Jarvis to the physical world, I am increasingly beginning to think that the full mystery we began to uncover during the last series of Anomalies: ancient secrets and cults, rebirth and reformation, fragmentation and unification, may not yet be behind us. Jarvis, Lynton-Wolfe and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") stand at the center of this mystery.

**Lightman and Nagassa speak in metaphors and parables, but my sense is they know something tangible. How might their posts connect to what we know of Jarvis, Lynton-Wolfe or Johnson, and what does that mean for our understanding of them?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, references and speculation.
