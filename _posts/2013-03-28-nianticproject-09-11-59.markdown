Node 04 is turning into a hotbed of activity as Resistance and Enlightened agents swarm the location in an attempt to break the stalemate.

Once again, Enlightened links were shortlived, and failed to make the jump window.

[#ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingress "")<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Ingress</h2>Links between Nodes 04 and 10 are established then destroyed. Enlightened continue to hold Node 04, where Hannah will remain unless a link is established or the Resistance retake the Node at the next scheduled jump.<br /><br /></div>
