Here's the second page of the conversation from yesterday.

It brings to the surface some nodes that we we've been tracking, but haven't yet found the connective tissue between:

Artifacts. Alexander's Quest. Prophecies of rising and falling civilizations, and at this end of the spectrum, Hank Johnson, ADA and the search for immortality.

Investigators, I have two challenges for you today:

**First, based on the assumption that ****+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")****Â may be using Alexander's life and journeys as a map into the past, can we speculate as to what places he may have visited recently? We know he was in Afghanistan and Berlin, but where else? Second, can we connect what's known of Alexander's life, journey and conquests to what's known of 13MAGNUS, the Shaper Glyphs and, for lack of a better word, the 'Immortality' Artifacts?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
