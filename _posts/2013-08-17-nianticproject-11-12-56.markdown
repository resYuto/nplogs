Many things in motion.

A series of recent transcripts reveal that Dr. Oliver-Lynton Wolfe, architect of the Ingress Scanner Technology has ransacked +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")'s XM stockpile and is planning on arming Enlightened Agents during Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") on Saturday. From what I've read of him, the man is highly unstable. Resistance and Enlightened agents alike should keep an eye out for him, and my advice is... keep your distance.

Reports began surfacing yesterday of a series of audio fragments emerging from the portals. 36 pieces in total have been discovered, and they contain what is believed to be a 'Manifesto' from Jarvis, a call to all Agents to embrace the Shapers and become Enlightened. It goes into great detail on a number of topics. Resistance and Enlightened both will find much to discuss.

Susanna Moyer, despite having her [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") broadcast hijacked not once but twice, adamantly continues to report daily on Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") from a series of safehouses around Washington D.C.

I wish her luck. These days, we all need that.

**Our topic for today, and as usual a passcode to all those who join in thoughtful conversation... The Jarvis Manifesto. It's a hell of a speech. Personally, it's going to take a bit more convincing before I 'pattern' myself and disappear into the ether for my new-found eternal life, but I'm curious to hear your thoughts and reactions.**
