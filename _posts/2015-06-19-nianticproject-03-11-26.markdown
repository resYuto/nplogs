As the  [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "")  Finale approaches, +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") examines the stakes of this massive global struggle. At its heart lies the destiny of +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), the powerful Glyph Researcher who was scattered into the Portal Network following Jahan's failed Shōnin Stone ritual at the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan.

Now, Jahan is attempting to activate another powerful Nest. This one, of Anti-Magnus origin, lies below the ancient city of Persepolis, and is said to hold N'zeer technology that could dramatically alter the state of mankind, curing many of its ills. +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") is among those to have loudly criticized Jahan's plans. Until recently he had openly stated that he would travel to Persepolis and stop her. Now, however, leaked video from a NOMAD shoot has revealed that Hank Johnson's plans may have changed. A document recovered in Washington DC by Agents containing a perplexing Glyph message only adds to the mystery.

Meanwhile, the Faction struggles to control the  [#LightmanShards](https://plus.google.com/s/%23LightmanShards "")  continues. Agents share their reports from Sri-Lanka, Lebanon, Taiwan and more.

At the Portland Anomaly, Agents will be able to take part in +[GORUCK](https://plus.google.com/107886514797510492384 "") Spec-Ops training exercises to benefit their Factions.

Susanna Moyer will be in Utrecht to witness the Persepolis Finale and meet with Agents., and reports are also circulating that +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") will be in Portland. Klue's last appearance there, following the events of  [#TimeZero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23TimeZero "") , caused her to experience a change of heart and embrace the cause of the Enlightenment. Is something similar in stow for Saturday?

Good luck to all this weekend.
