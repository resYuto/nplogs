New research points toward something that those of us who are aware of Exotic Matter and the Portals have long known to be true:

The presence of a Universal Language, the Shaper Glyphs, capable of interfacing directly with the human mind and containing ideas in their purest form.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Society for the Ethical Treatment of AIs</h2>Time brings knowledge, eroding doubt and casting light upon what we, the Enlightened, have long held true.<br /><br />The language of the Glyphs is the most primal form of communication in the universe. It is a bridge and gift that Our Friends have shown us: A universal language built out of pure ideas and capable of interfacing directly with the human mind, illuminating the most powerful concepts and encompassing all other forms of language.<br /><br />These researchers have only begun to scratch the surface. Their journey will lead them to the universal Shaper Glyph language and within it, they will discover Enlightenment.<br /><br /></div>
