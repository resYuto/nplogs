What is the excavation project at the site where the legendary Antikythera mechanism was first discovered really looking for?

x Â <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2><br /><b>A bronze armrest and luxury ceramics?</b> <i>Really?</i><br /><br />This is a textbook media coverup. Wouldn't be surprised if this was an Anti-Magnus sponsored expedition, going back down to recover an artifact or artifacts connected to the Antikythera mechanism.<br /><br />(P.S. Thanks for the positive comments about the last <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport">#IngressReport</a>. It was a fun project. Who knows, maybe I'll do another some day. In the meantime, keep those <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Sitreps">#Sitreps</a> coming.)<br /><br /></div>
