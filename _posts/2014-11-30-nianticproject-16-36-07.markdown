"The fear of technology as applied to humans... The past rising with vengeance.... All of it is related to the conflict between Shaper and N’zeer."

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Sight relapse. Studying documents and resting. In and out. Peaceful here.<br /><br />Studied the breadcrumb portals. More came back. There are more out there. Much of it focused on the Diodati Epiphany which ripples to this day.  So much came from there...  Vampyres in the formal sense. The fear of technology as applied to humans (Frankenstein). Mummies. The past rising with vengeance.  <br /><br />All of it is related to the conflict between Shaper and N’zeer.<br /><br />Why that villa, those people, during the Volcanic Winter? I don’t know. But I think there will be answers. Jahan has shown me similar things. Whole mythologies born out of very contained local events. The cosmology of a universe uttered in a breath.<br /><br /></div>
