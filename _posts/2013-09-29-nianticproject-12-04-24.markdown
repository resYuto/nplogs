I've now managed to obtain all the pages from the second Tycho comic. I'll be sharing them with you all over the coming days whenever opportunity affords.

After yesterday's revelations, Agents have been quick to begin organization and planning for the expected series of Emergent XM Anomalies, currently known as Operation [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS ""). It would be wise to remember lessons learned from the last major set of Anomalies: Every city and every Agent makes a difference, and the day is won just as much by those who arrive at the site on the day of the Anomaly as by those who plan and execute broader strategic goals days, weeks and months in advance.

Your planning window begins now, Agents, use it wisely.

**Today I'm proposing our discussion adopt a slightly different format. Based on our speculation of what 13MAGNUS might be and who might be involved, what pieces of evidence from the past year of our investigation should we bring to the surface for those less well-versed in what's transpired so far, and why?**

A passcode, as always, to those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion today.
