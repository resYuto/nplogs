+[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") is looking for more information about new intel that allegedly emerged at the  [#Shonin](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Shonin "")   Anomalies today.

So am I.

From what I've heard, there was some kind of XM event. Jahan's N'zeer summoning? Did it go wrong?

If you saw or heard something, please share what you discovered. Hopefully we can work together to fill in the gaps...
