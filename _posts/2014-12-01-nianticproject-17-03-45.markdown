*"Looking at the ancient artworks, I can't help but wonder if they are not visions from other places… Other times.  Jahan said an interesting thing the other day, or maybe it was today.  Maybe it was right now.  Maybe it was an infinity ago...."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2><br /><b>A MOMENT OF CONTEMPLATION:</b><br /><br />As we all know, there are special places in the world that almost seem to exist somewhere out of time. I have been meditating today about the relationship between recursion and reincarnation. Recreation and reanimation.  Thoughts drifting. It seems here like I can meditate on a thought for a lifetime. I have begun healing not only at a physical level. Wounds better, but at a psychic level. The cacophony is turning into distinct voices and the voices are becoming quieter.  <br /><br />Looking at the ancient artworks, I can't help but wonder if they are not visions from other places… Other times.  Jahan said an interesting thing the other day, or maybe it was today.  Maybe it was right now.  Maybe it was an infinity ago. In any case she said, “If we have an infinite universe with infinite possibilities, doesn’t, then, anything we can imagine exist somewhere?”<br /><br /></div>
