<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>I've recovered these fragments of an XM Anomaly Report from Hulong Transglobal that reveal key new mechanics associated with the Aegis Nova Anomaly Series. Important reading for those who will be involved in these Anomalies, either as Planners or on the ground. I suspect that declassified versions of this document will emerge directly from Hulong Transglobal in the following days.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
