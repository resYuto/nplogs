Can Pandora be put back in the box?

Ken Owen looks back on the challenges faced by the NIA as they attempted to bury the constant stream of revelations emerging from the leak of the Ingress Scanner and the discovery of the Niantic Project.

What's clear from the tone of the memorandum is that the NIA hasn't given up their goal of re-writing the status quo. Those of us in the Investigative Community are among the tiny majority who know the scope and scale of the Ingress coverup, and to the NIA, we are a threat.

**No amnesty, the memo promises. The question then, is not whether or not we are in Ken Owen's sights. That much, we can assume is true, or will be very soon. The question is, what does that threat mean? What does it mean to Investigators such as yourselves? What might it mean to those like me or P. A. Chapeau who stand closer to the center of the leaks. What are his tactics, and how do they differ from those of Jay Phillips? How might Owen attempt to silence us?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
