Where is Calvin right, and where is he squarely wrong?

I obtained this recording of Calvin speaking to an unknown party about his misgivings and fears about Portals, the Shapers and what 'Ingress' means to him. The timing is unknown, but if I had to guess, I would place it during, or perhaps even before, his tenure at the Niantic Project

Ultimately, to me, it's a reminder of the subjective nature of our understanding of what is going on all around us. Our opinions are shaped by the hopes and fears of those closest to the Niantic Conspiracy, and the weight of navigating through it all and determining our own place rests squarely on us.

**How do you process Calvin's ideas? Where do they align with your own, and where do you think he's squarely wrong?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
