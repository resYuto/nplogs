The good guys? I'll believe that when I see it.

A series of leaked emails between Jay Phillips and Ken Owen, lone operators at the helm of the NIA, reveals their growing list of concerns. On the one hand, the continued growth of information about Exotic Matter, Ingress and the Portals. On the other, the absolute train-wreck of a situation that's unfolded largely at the Agency's hands, and that now stains their reputation to all those in the know.

I searched around but have not yet discovered any Niantic Investigator reports of the so called 'secret messages' hidden in +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s music. Do you any of you have information regarding this? +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), too, has not publicly released any new Glyphs he may have uncovered from the music. It seems that in this case, the analysts at the NIA are a step ahead of us. What are your thoughts about the NIA? Especially given some of the speculation around the recent videos that were injected to the Ingress Report. Could they ever be perceived as 'the good guys?'
