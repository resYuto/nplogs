[#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")   04

Congratulations to the Resistance.  They have claimed   [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")   04 with their focus.  

An eventful day in Austin, as developments emerged and questions remain.  Both factions had a lot to take in today.

What is the purpose of the XM Detection Vehicle  [#NL1331](https://plus.google.com/s/%23NL1331 "")   ?  Agents caught a glimpse of it driving around the streets of Austin, but have any come in direct contact with the vehicle?  What was it doing there, and where will it go next?

Agents in Austin were also taken by surprise at the end of the Anomaly with +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") delivering the Cluster 4 Volatiles.  What are we to make of his appearance in Texas?  IS Hank alive?  If  [#hankisalive](https://plus.google.com/s/%23hankisalive "")   , how?

 [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")   04 keeps us on pins and needles.  And our toes.
