Judging from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s Google+ posts, it's become clear that his relationship with Jahan has grown more complex. He's grown fond of her... It almost seems like she's become a kind of muse for him.

I am happy for him, but also concerned.

This surveillance video emerged a little earlier today. There are some things in here that worry me. I'll let you watch and come to your own conclusions.
