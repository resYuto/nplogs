Anyone who's been following recent developments knows that Carrie Campbell sent  +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") on a glyph hunt at a major ( [#ingressdays](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingressdays "") ) anomaly at the Robert E. Howard Museum in Cross Plains, Texas this week, 77 years after REH's suicide. 

If you don't know about Howard, look it up, will be important. Get in touch with your inner HPL while you're at it. Right now, the important thing is to take a look at HJ's post. He's on the run... hunted. Possibly by the same people who were after him in Africa. I think he's looking for the San Saba mines, but not for the reason you might think.

+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s  novel, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).  <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>i’ll post when i can. bad connections out here and a lot of data to send.  not to mention the fact that an occasional bullet is whizzing past me.  i’ve got a pretty good idea where the mine is, and i’ve got a pretty good idea what i’m going to find there.  see if you came to the same conclusions about what howard is alluding to that i am...  i see jim bowie’s name and i think i know where this story ends.<br /><br /> <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingress">#ingress</a>   <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23nianticproject">#nianticproject</a>  <br /><br /></div>
