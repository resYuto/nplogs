They began to detect a signal in New Taipei City even before the Anomaly again, but it did not emerge in strength until after the day had come to an end.

The voice of +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 ""), the egotistical, sometimes easily manipulated, but undoubtably brilliant father of the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") XM scanner would be heard for the first time since the Niantic researchers disappeared into the Portal Network.

He claims to have seen into the heart of the N'zeer, and brings with him a warning of what he fears from them.

His message also seems to reveal what the Enlightened could hope to gain in [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon ""): To return the patterns of the researchers to human form. But what if they fail? Will they remain in the Portal Network... or something else?
