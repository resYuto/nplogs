The Future is Now, for +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""), at least.

A leaked internal memo from Hulong Director Catherine Fan to her company stakeholders reveals that the XM giant's R&amp;D strategy may be about to change.

It's interesting that Catherine Fan indicates her intention to meet the San Jose 'technology' team on Saturday, the same date as the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") Anomaly.Â 

*It seems to me that Agents might be able to influence the decision makers at work by exploiting the Anomaly's Shaping power.*

**While the Corporations have never officially stated ideological or strategic alliance with either 'faction,' this is the first time a clear bias in R&amp;D has been acknowledged. What might happen if Hulong decides to pursue a strategy that favors one or the other Faction? How might the other Faction cope with this loss of a strategic source for XM technology, and how might the other Corporations figure into the situation? Have the other Corporations exhibited similar development biases in the past?**

A passcode will be shared with those who enrich our conversation with meaningful observations, insights and references.
