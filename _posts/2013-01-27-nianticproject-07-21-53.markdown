I wonder what tomorrow might hold. The deadline Jarvis issued to The Enlightened is hurtling towards us, and both factions have vowed to establish a firm claim on the Cahokia Mounds at sundown tomorrow, but of course, only one will succeed.

Speaking of The Enlightened, I found this Google+ account ([https://plus.google.com/109700835254046153835/posts](https://plus.google.com/109700835254046153835/posts "")). It claims to have information about the multiple new portals that suddently appeared at the Mounds, and how they might affect the battle tomorrow.Â
