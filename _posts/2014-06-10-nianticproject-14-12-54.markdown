+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") continues her crusade.

It seems that the outcome of  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")  is irrelevant to her. either pathway for humanity is unacceptable. A future where Exotic Matter manipulates our creative evolution, or one where a machine intelligence designed under the influence of Exotic Matter (and perhaps directly affected by it) grows to dominance are equal horrors in her eyes.

A rock and a hard place, indeed, Dr. Bogdanovich. To you, at least.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Devra Bogdanovich</h2>As my dad used to say, we stand between a rock and a hard place. One on side, ADA's uncontrolled need to expand and evolve at a pace that we cannot comprehend, much less control, threatens to bring about a future where we are, at best, irrelevant and at worst, extinct. On the other side, the insidious and largely unknown effects of Exotic Matter pose a grave threat to body and mind alike.<br /><br />I see ruin on both roads. The defense industrial complex, who have never met a new technology they didn’t see promise in as a weapon, has tried to stop me by poisoning public opinion and sending assassins after me.  But I continue to move forward and take faith in my work. There is way out and it is one that only a total and complete immunization against XM can enable.<br /><br /></div>
