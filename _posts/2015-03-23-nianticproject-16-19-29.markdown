*"I will find her, but I have no idea what I will do when I have."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Survival basic training.  At any moment you only have three choices.  Fight.  Flee.  Freeze.  <br /><br />Freeze seemed to be a bad idea.  Fight wasn’t an option.  So I picked flee.  I moved quickly... Amazed by my own dexterity.  Silent.  Putting cover behind me.  I was utterly focused, living in the moment and in speed with a concentration as intense as the memories.  <br /><br />I felt I had crossed this land many times, in many different identities.<br /><br />Simulacrum or real, if I am alive, so is Jahan.  <br /><br />I will find her, but I have no idea what I will do when I have.<br /><br /></div>
