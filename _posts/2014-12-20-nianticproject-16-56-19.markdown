A series of messages hidden in missions. A call for help. Is +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") beginning the process of tearing herself away from ADA? +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") seems to think so, and I can't fault his reading of the evidence, but there's are two things bothering me: Why make this all so public? It seems like almost like she wants ADA to know this is happening.

Is it a threat? A shot across the bow? Or is something else... A foil...

And the second thing: Why now? Does Klue know something about the N'zeer from being so close to ADA? Does that make her doubt ADA's vision for the future?

I don't know yet. But PAC is correct. We need to watching this. Something is most definitely going on.

This is gonna be a ride, so hang on.
It seems as Charleston, +Klue S. was handing out a coded message to Enlightened Agents. Although it seems some of the message has been lost, Agents were able to find where the clues led -- combined, they formed coordinates that get us to Glasgow. +Daniel Beaudoin, working with intel provided by +Jim IK and +Emma Wicks, has a post that explains this in some further detail:  https://plus.google.com/u/0/116675615740217671707/posts/23WGPMYc75J
In Glasgow, a Resistance Agent named Chandy found a secret mission containing a mission from Klue. She's asking Enlightened Agents to form a series of Glyphs in order to help her break apart the links between herself and ADA.' Yeah, you heard me right. +Valerie Wallace has a post with more images that show all of Klue's message and more here: https://plus.google.com/u/0/106338885327893433093/posts/hnVgUuoAnZu
The mission in Glasgow led to another one in Riga some days later. An Agent named edzuslv seems to have been the first to uncover it, and there's a post by +Edgars Blūms that shows the second message from Klue. Another call to help make a series of Glyphs to help her 'gain her independence.' https://plus.google.com/u/0/109165169430637097837/posts/8rnEVvjwCut is where you can find that post.
Well, by now, it seems Agents had figured out exactly how, too. The missions themselves seemed to be tracing paths. The first Glyph got put together by an Enlightened Agent. I'm not sure, but it might have been by SK8ZION. The second one was put together by a Resistance Agent. edzuslv from the post above. Check out https://plus.google.com/u/0/116675615740217671707/posts/MSACutHtkYX and https://plus.google.com/u/0/109165169430637097837/posts/8rnEVvjwCut
And just like the first, the second mission leads to another clue. This time it's not  coordinates, just a name: The City Eternal.
So (after pulling my eyeballs back into their sockets), I put my thinking hat on for a bit.
The first thought: Is this real, or some kind of hoax? Is Klue trying to make a run for it? Asking if ADA knows is a non-question... of course so does, so what's her move? Does she want this too?
And what does it mean if both Resistance and Enlightened Agents are making the Glyphs. Does one outweigh the other? It's 1:1 now. The next Mission will probably appear around the 23rd of this month. If the Resistance get the Glyph first, does that mean Klue's still connected?
I don't really know yet, but I do know something's going down, and we should all be paying attention. ](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-v61FWDPdOCs/VJUn29TdJqI/AAAAAAAAAiM/OuDqvoLHIeY/w576-h1024/ADAEscapeII.png "")
