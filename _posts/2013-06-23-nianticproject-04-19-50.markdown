This just came out.

+[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") has just raised the offer for a glimpse at one of the images from the package recovered by the Enlightened at  [#timezero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero "")  today.

Folks, it looks like we might be standing at the beginning of an all out bidding war. Now to see if +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") joins the fight...

-PAC<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hulong Transglobal</h2>Enlightened:<br /><br />I am Catherine Fan, leader of Hulong Transglobal’s XM efforts. <br /><br />You no doubt have heard from our good friends at IQTech.  Do not be misled. Despite what you have heard about us from biased western sources, Hulong Transglobal is a noble company with vast vision. Our corporate motto, Bringing the Billions into Tomorrow, represents our grand vision of a better future. We understand that one of you is in possession of a package containing images of ancient symbols recovered by Hank Johnson in a mine in Texas, USA. While IQTech has certainly made a compelling offer, Hulong Transglobal is prepared to raise by the bar by generously offering 12 one time passcodes for our revolutionary ForceAmp MODs in exchange for one of the images contained in the Hank Johnson package. <br /><br />If you wish to capitalize on this offer, please respond and include an image verifying your participation in <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero">#timezero</a>.<br /><br /></div>
