Operation  [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")  - Mumbai has passed its Second Measurement.

According to intelligence sources, the Faction that captures this Anomaly will obtain information leading to the location of one of the shards of the Jarvis XM Entity.

The Enlightened, perhaps motivated by this, have begun to act more aggressively. Although they captured this Measurement, the Anomaly remains ever so slightly in the Resistance's grip.
