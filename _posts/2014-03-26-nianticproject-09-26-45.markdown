Somber words from the Nomad.

Time is running out for him.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2><br /><b>As few heard my words in Denver, I will post them here.</b><br /><br />My Enlightened Friends.<br /><br />For the record, I had not verified that I was a simulacrum until I discovered my own corpse on December 14th at the 13MAGNUS nest in Afghanistan. Yes, I knew something was wrong. I remember gunshots penetrating my body and then darkness until Special Forces found me wandering in the hills dazed, but unharmed. I spent years searching for an explanation. And like many truths, it led me back to the beginning.<br /><br />I am a simulacrum trapped in a 1331 day cycle of life and death, unless I succeed where even Alexander the Great failed. I need your help. The Ingression window is closing. ADA controls four of Alexander's Artifacts and plans to use them to strip us of our humanity. Enlightened, we must prevail, for the consequences of failure are beyond imagination.<br /><br />Hank Johnson<br /><br /></div>
