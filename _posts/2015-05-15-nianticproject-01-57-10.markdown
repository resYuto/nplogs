Last week, 41 XM Shards containing the pattern of Glyph Researcher, +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), appeared in the Portal Network. Agents from both Factions went to work immediately to guide these Shards to their respective target Portals and influence Stein Lightman's future.

Recent reports suggest that Anti-Magnus leader, Jahan, may be close to reaching the ancient city of Persepolis in Iran. +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") has promised to confront her and prevent her from activating ancient N'zeer technology. Jahan claims this technology will alleviate human suffering, but Enlightened leaders have reviled these claims.

A mysterious video feed has emerged that appears to show P. A. Chapeau using a sequence of Glyphs to separate the consciousnesses of +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 ""). Its veracity has not been confirmed, and Klue's current status is unknown.

From Norway, five Resistance Agents share a 2000km road trip around the country, from Vietnam, two Agents go on a journey to create over 36 massive Fields across the countryside, and from Hunstville, AL, Agent s0h0 documents a tremendously successful first Saturday.
