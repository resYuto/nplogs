The most current intel suggests that this Anomaly will begin on the evening of Friday June 7th, and end on Saturday June 8th.

Details remain scarce about the exact nature of this anomaly, but both a leaked memo from within Strategic Explorations and an email from Carrie Campbell to Hank Johnson suggest that an emergent anomaly will take place in Cross Plains, TX on June 7th and 8th.

I will update this event as I obtain more details...
