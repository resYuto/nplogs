Did +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "")'s allegiance ever truly lie with +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""), or was it always a facade?

In this surveilled recording, we learn much, much more about what's really going on between Jarvis and the XM Savant. 

These are desperate times for +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), but I hope he knows what he's doing.
