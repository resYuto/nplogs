Since my previous update, Agent +[Richard Walden](https://plus.google.com/112217333135124700456 "") and some of his Enlightened comrades uploaded a video revealing that the [#timezero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero "") package was indeed not destroyed, and if recent updates are to be believed, all three XM development companies (+[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") and +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "")) have reached out to the agents to query them on their openness to trading the contents of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s cache of images from the San Saba mine. 

The video I received today was edited and uploaded by Hank's camera operator from Cross Plains. According to him, they were scheduled to remain there and cover the [#ingressdays](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingressdays "") anomaly, but upon discovering the large white symbol on the ground there, Hank became agitated and left. 

The camera operator waited for him to return, but he never did. The only time we've heard from him since was in a series of videos uploaded by +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 ""), although he was last believed to be in Paris, where he handed the [#timezero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero "") package to a courier to bring into London.
