+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares moments of his journey en-route to Hanover.

Agents have reported spotting him on the ground there earlier today.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>In Hanover. Quite the journey...  (long post, been writing this in bits and pieces on my various transits)<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I made it to Qurayyat after motoring most of the night and coming in under sail just before dawn.  Mostly quiet although what I think was an Iranian military speed boat came within visual contact range sometime past midnight.  Paid the captain and took a dip. Swam in from a half mile off the coast.  Was a mess.  First stop was to see an old friend.  Retired from the Oman ISS.  Was able to get a passport and some other necessities including a dry set of clothes and a shower and shave.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Got what I needed.  Got a vehicle too.  Mercedes G-class 6 x 6.  Plan was to try and get out via Muscat.  Made it out to see Azmati’s uncle.  Thought I was going to have issues at a checkpoint but they seemed to recognize the vehicle.  No questions asked.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Azmati’s uncle wanted to know every detail.  I spared nothing: The grasping hand, the dying words, the macabre task of removing the dagger, the coin, cutting my fingers on the shards of the Shōnin Stone. Azmati’s Uncle gave us both the simulacrum test. We are flesh and blood and I will forever have a scar to show it, but a few drops of blood and a scar are a small price to pay for the knowledge that I am real.<br /><br />And for what it is worth, Azmati’s ‘uncle’ is really his uncle.  He’s almost the same age as Azmati and I would have believed they were twins if I didn’t know otherwise. He confirmed a suspicion that has been growing in me ever since Jahan’s Palace, that certain highly venerated ancient objects, Transdimensional Artifacts, were more than works of art.  Or at least the original versions were.  Like the Shōnin stone, they incorporated N’zeer technology and were functional.  Later copies followed the form, but lacking N’zeer know-how, were inert. The analogy would be something like a smart phone.  When charged and networked, it has extraordinary powers -- powers that would have seemed magical to our  great grandfathers.  Without charge and network it would be a shiny object of glass and metal, interesting and beautiful in its own right, but useless.  <br /><br />Then, imagine this powerful Artifact simply vanished.  The human would attempt to create his own.  A replica could be made. It would look similar, but it wouldn’t actually work. If it were in the hands of a priest or potentate, he would have to simulate its effects until he was discovered perpetrating a fraud.  But it would be copied and imitated by generations. They would forget that it actually existed and would forget its purpose, but understand the symbolism that had grown up around it.  And the legends would continue to be told and could remain in a civilization forever, passed down unwittingly.  <br /><br />When one looks at Illuminated Manuscripts, good luck charms and ancient symbols in this light, the implications are clear.<br /><br />In any case, Azmati’s clan has been trying to assemble as many of these objects as it could, ever since.  So too has Jahan and her supporters, hence the antiquities business, the hidden library, the secret vaults. They examined hundreds of thousands of artifacts, but only have a handful of confirmed true Transdimensional Artifacts.<br /><br />There was one interesting detail.  It concerns Persepolis... More on that later.<br /><br />	<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />	<br /><br />Made it to Muscat late last night (or was it the night before? Things get blurry with all the travel).  Tried out my identity and credit cards at the Intercontinental hotel.  My first night in real bed since I left Jahan’s palace.  My head still spins when I think about that time.  For a few weeks I lived in ignorance.  Blissful, incredibly happy ignorance.  <br /><br />Walked to the beach and swam for an hour in the gulf when I woke up.  The humidity was as stifling as the thoughts of Azmati and Jahan which I can’t shake.  Got a flight from Muscat to Dubai.  A friend picked me up to briefly visit a dig site outside of Abu-Dhabi.  It’s near an air force base that officially doesn’t exist.  Fortunately we didn’t get shot and he didn’t crash his Ferrari on the way there or back (he’s been known to hit 300 km/h while doing conference calls). I don’t think we were followed.  Not sure about eyes overhead.  Lots of activity around the base.  They think they found another artifact.  Possibly a sister to the Shōnin stone.  There may be another nest.  Possibly abandoned.  This new find is in safe hands.  For now.<br /><br />After that, the flight to Frankfurt.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />At the moment, nobody seems to be trying to kill or kidnap me. They probably believe that I have no useful information and am as confused as they are. In that they are right.  <br /><br />I came to Hanover to meet a contact given to me by Azmati's uncle. After that, I have a couple other things to do in the area. Might be headed to Wünsdorf to try and understand more about what happened at the 13MAGNUS Nest. I don't know what Oliver's status is.  More soon. <br /><br /></div>
