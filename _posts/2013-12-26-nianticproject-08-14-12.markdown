Here is the third and final piece of Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s Niantic Welcome speech.

When the applause ended, the team set to work, determining, as Bogdanovich said, what would replace the world they had walked in from moments before.

**And so, my question today asks that very question: What is the new world the Niantic Project created? How has the knowledge of XM and the Ingress Scanner Technology changed you and changed the world around you? What changes do you foresee for the future?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
