+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), on the brink of the  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")   XM Anomaly in Santa Fe, shares a final message.

ADA has offered to create a digital version of his identity, no doubt storing it nearby, perhaps at the supercomputer facility she has rooted herself in.

He is a man with few options, and the one thing we know of ADA to be absolutely true, is that she is always thinking many, many steps ahead.

I believe much rests on the Agents in Santa Fe and across the world today.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>T-32 days to  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion">#Recursion</a> .<br /><br />This is my last entry before the Anomaly at Santa Fe.<br /><br />ADA contacted me.  She offered to preserve my memories, all the knowledge I have obtained in the last three years and to provide that back to me after the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion">#Recursion</a> .<br /><br />I am still pondering this.  I want to remain who I am, but I am worried about why she is offering to help. <br /><br />She seems to believe my knowledge will help her in other ways.  God help us if that is true.<br /><br /></div>
