My admiration for +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") runs deep. She's smart and passionate, but also tends to run a little bit idealistic. She hasn't seen as much of the world as I have, and that's OK. The world needs its idealists, but it also needs its realists, the cautious and the paranoid.

See her written statement here: [http://goo.gl/92r0zO](http://goo.gl/92r0zO "")

Yes, Klue, we can always do better, and we will. But we'll do it ourselves. If you'll recall, you're the one who first said that.

I'm always weary of someone who claims they have a simple and immediate solution to a problem. Brick by brick, individual drops of sweat falling as we push forward, that's how we evolve, that's how we grow.

Klue's statement today is eloquent. I don't disagree with her vision of tomorrow nor her reasoning for why we need it, and as you all know I'm no friend to the likes of the NIA, but I can't share her reasoning. What are your thoughts? It's a complicated matter, and I recognize that opinions will greatly differ. As always, a passcode for meaningful participation.
