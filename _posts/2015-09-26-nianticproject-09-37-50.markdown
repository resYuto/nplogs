Around the world, preparations for [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") are starting to ramp up. On September 19th, Agents took part in Mission days around the world (with more just around the corner), and dozens of epic operations, ranging from Operation: MFT in Iceland, to Operation: Midgard in Japan, to massive E8 farms and Link Bursts have been undertaken by Agents everywhere. Hank looks at over twenty of the biggest and best Sitreps to cross his radar.

Hank Johnson also shares critical new intel about the upcoming Flash Shard Anomalies, which will impact Boston and Houston on October 10th.
