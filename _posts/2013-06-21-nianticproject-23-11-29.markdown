I've gone through Jarvis's transmission, and I'm fairly certain I know what it means... Jarvis is somehow pulling Klue towards him, and he intends to make her his pawn.

This will happen on March 2nd at 4:00PM at the William Wallace Monument near Stirling, Scotland.

Jarvis intends to capture her essence by trapping the monument in an Enlightened field, and controlling the majority of the portals nearby. I normally don't take sides, but I know I want to help Klue. I'm calling on Resistance operatives in the area to make every effort to save her by foiling Jarvis's plan...

Operatives have confirmed there will be scanner activation codes on the ground there.
