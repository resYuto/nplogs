The truth about +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "")'s beginnings lies hidden deep in an offline archive of data.

It seems +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") is seeking +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "")'s help to obtain this information. 

Three questions emerge.

The first question is: will Moyer help Klue and ADA?

The second question is: Will ADA honor her promise? Will she allow Klue to go her own way after having known the Algorithm's inner workings so intimately?

The third, and most important question is: Is ADA ready to learn the uncomfortable truths about her own creation?
