Fire.

Ezekiel Calvin, a man of impressive reach, locates +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "") and leverages a superior position of power, threatening to sabotage Lynton-Wolfe's negotations with +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "").

Why? 

It seems Calvin has taken an interest in the flagging health of Enlightened ideologue +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""). It's unclear exactly what his play is, but the solution, if Lynton-Wolfe is correct, is a journey down a path filled with danger.
