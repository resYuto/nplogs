Two days ago, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") uploaded Robert's letter about going to the San Saba mine. Today, Lovecraft responds with a cryptic warning. More glyphs and more warnings. We first heard about these from +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""),  +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "") passed her something at the Magic Castle and warned her not to look at them in sequence. 

Klue reached out to Carrie Campbell, who also seemed shaken by what she read. Her work at Niantic involved symbols as well, a piece of research dismissed by the NIA as 'an art project.'

A series of cryptic, encoded communications between Hank and Carrie revealed that they were both on the trail of a hidden mine, possible the San Saba mines, and that their real target was not a payload of silver, but something of far greater power and value. 

I'm still trying to figure out how all this connects to Greenwich Park and London.
