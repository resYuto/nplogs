Agents in Boulder tomorrow will get a chance to interact with the simulacrum of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""). He's the only Hank we've ever known, and I wonder how, if we are ever able to, interacting with 'the real Hank' would be different. I don't know if we will ever be able to answer that question... time is running out for Hank, and the Resistance and ADA control all captured [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") Artifacts so far.

I've been told that Tycho's newest work, a compendium of all his comics so far including a new issue of which we've seen pieces recently, is nearing completion. 

Unconfirmed rumors are surfacing that agents in Los Angeles and Berlin may be able to obtain copies at the  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Anomalies there.
