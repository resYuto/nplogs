+[Paul School](https://plus.google.com/109763890472937053947 ""), a former colleague of Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") from her days at Arecibo, recently reached out to +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""). He claimed to have received some form of message from Bogdanovich. 

Hank first met Paul over a decade ago, after encountering Devra while in Arecibo researching 13MAGNUS. ( [http://goo.gl/f8ftPj](http://goo.gl/f8ftPj "") , [http://goo.gl/26gr25](http://goo.gl/26gr25 "") )

It's unclear if Paul's messages from Devra are real or not, but we thought the same when we first saw Jarvis. ([http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc201b](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc201b ""))
