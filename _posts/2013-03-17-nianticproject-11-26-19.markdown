SHE DID IT?

This just in... Misty managed to use the energy from the Portal anomalies, and the combined power amassed by both factions to hyperthread out of Niantic.

They said it wasn't possible? Details still unclear... They say she appeared, spoke some short words and left.

Does anyone out in the field know more?
