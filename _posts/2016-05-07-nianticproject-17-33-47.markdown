Meet fellow Agents, introduce new recruits to the community and help the Ingress Investigation solve an important mystery by recovering intel via a high priority mission.

Meet-up around the Bear Portal on UCSD: 1:30PM-2:30PM

Mission goes live: Approximately 2:30PM

Other events of interest (via [http://artpower.ucsd.edu/filmatic/events](http://artpower.ucsd.edu/filmatic/events ""))

Ingress Gaming Meetup
1:30 pm Presentation; 2:30 Game Starts | Calit2 Theater/VROOM
Join Flint Dille, creative lead of Ingress, to play the augmented reality game and meet other players at this official Ingress event that will explore UC San Diego monuments and landmarks including the Stuart Collection. All attendees are encouraged to participate.

Filmatic events require ticket and payment. Agents can participate in the Meetup and Mission even if they are not attending the Filmatic events at UCSD.

For those of you who will be on the ground in San Diego tomorrow and are new to the Investigation, I've prepared a top-line report to help you get up to speed.
