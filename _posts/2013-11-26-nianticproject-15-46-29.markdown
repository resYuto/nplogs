Help us. Lead us. Improve us. Liberate us.

But who is us? And who is being asked?

Thanks to the fine speculation from members of the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Investigative Community, Dr. +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") has revealed the translation of the Glyphs sequence from +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s most recent piece of music.

The results are puzzling, and perhaps troubling.

**Here are the questions, and I hope that our collective speculation might lead us closer to the an understanding of this message: Did enoch put the message in his music video himself, or did it appear there of its own accord? If enoch put it in there consciously, was he aware of what the message meant, or did the Glyphs simply pass through, using him as the channel. And finally, the big question: Who is the message from, and who is it to? With the voice of Roland Jarvis floating in the music, the obvious answer is easy... but there are other perspectives, and the implications are worth considering.**

A passcode to those who enrich this conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references. Two passcodes to those who help enhance a new Investigator's knowledge.
