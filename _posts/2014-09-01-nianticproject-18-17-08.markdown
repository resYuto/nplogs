An infintite quest for ever-deeper knowledge...

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") explores a new Glyph that resonates with his love of science and the quest to uncover the unending mysteries of the universe.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>While I'm not fully prepared to go on the record with the meaning of this new Glyph, discovered during the course of the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios">#Helios</a>  Artifacts Investigations, I feel it is highly likely that it is a 'sentence form' Glyph, which we have seen before in the structures 'Clear-All' and 'Open-All.'<br /><br />An alternate possibility lies in a concept-oriented fusion of these two ideas, i.e. rather than Search-All, it may in fact represent an endless search... an infinite pursuit of knowledge.<br /><br />I prefer that interpretation, even if it turns out to be wrong. To me, it is like the mystery of the universe: Every answer leads to another question.<br /><br />What a beautiful construct! A noble and endless path for the inquisitive to travel and enrich their minds.<br /><br /></div>
