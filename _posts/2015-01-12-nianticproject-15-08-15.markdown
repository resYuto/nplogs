Agents from both Factions in Chicago discovered the latest [#ADAEscape](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADAEscape "") mission and built a series of Glyphs in the hope of advancing +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")'s liberation from ADA, but it seems something went wrong...Â 

Klue, in a message shared earlier today, points them in the right direction.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>You missed the clue I left for you...<br /><br />"The path to <b>freedom</b> <b>begins</b> here."<br /><br /></div>
