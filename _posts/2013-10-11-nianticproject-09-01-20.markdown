Do I hear 11 Million?

A number of pieces of information flying in today. Things seem to be heating up in the wake of [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS ""). I'm working to verify authenticity on these items as fast as I can. Expect to hear more soon.

Paul School, +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s colleague from her Arecibo days, is on the market with a document purportedly written by Johnson and Bogdanovich during that era.

Some quick thoughts to fuel our discussion before I run off to follow up on the remaining leaks I received today:

**Is this the document ADA is after? If so, has her plan gone awry? What might it  contain, and what was ****+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")**** doing in Puerto Rico 20 years ago? Why might that information be so valuable?** 

A passcode for those who enrich our conversation with observations, insights and references.
