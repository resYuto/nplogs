A new Glyph emerges: Reincarnate, to live again...

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")Â also proposes a thought exercise to the Investigative Community: To examine the spacial and connected nature of Glyphs in an attempt to uncover previously undiscovered forms.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>I was attempting to discover the Glyph for <i>Rebirth.</i><br /><br />I failed, instead uncovering this new form: <i>Reincarnation, to live again.</i> It seems to evoke the previous structures I had discovered for <i>Again/Repeat</i> and <i>Breathe/Live.</i><br /><br />As Investigators noted yesterday, many Glyphs combine or relate in interesting ways. <i>Creation</i> and <i>Destruction</i> are mirrored opposites, but also combine to create other patterns.<br /><br />I propose the following thought exercise and seek the input of the Investigative Community:<br /><br />What other Glyphs might exist based on either a spacial relationship between or combination of other Glyphs we already know to exist?<br /><br />I look forward to hearing and seeing your ideas.<br /><br /></div>
