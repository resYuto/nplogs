x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Got a distress signal via an old but trusted NIA pipeline.<br /><br />Worrying, but for now, need to confirm the source, most of the signal was lost, only scattered bits got through.<br /><br />That's all I know for now. Will keep you posted.<br /><br />Hank<br /><br />p.s. found that USB key, will share the contents later.<br /><br /></div>
