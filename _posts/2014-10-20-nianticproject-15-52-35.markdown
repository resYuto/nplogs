A new piece of intel from the same source who provided the information yesterday about the  [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "")  Anomalies and the impact they seemed to be having on the  [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "")  Artifact Portals, or beacons, as +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") has called them.

It appears that, following each Anomaly, the beacons emitted short, unique burst transmissions from near the Primary Anomaly sites. The content of these transmissions is currently unknown.
