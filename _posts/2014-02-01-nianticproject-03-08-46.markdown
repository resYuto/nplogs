The consequences of +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "")'s decision to confront +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") in Las Vegas and seek answers begin to mount. Those who would seek to do her harm will leap at any opportunity to collect on the bounty that rests on her head.

**What is so important about the Las Vegas Burst Operation? The rumors are swirling that it lies at the beginning of something larger, but its difficult to separate the speculation from the likely. Why would both Klue and Susanna put themselves in harm's way just to meet with each other and agents? What could possibly be important enough to accept that level of risk?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
