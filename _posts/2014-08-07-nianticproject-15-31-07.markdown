New problems call for new solutions, and it seems that for the first time in quite a while, the NIA is bringing a useful idea to the table, literally.

It wasn't hard to guess that +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s Portal Virus would strain the XM reserves at all the major XM corporations. It seems that, in the face of dwindling resources, the companies may band together to explore a unified solution and help bolster each other through the crisis. If, that is, the competing forces can put their differences aside for their collective good. According to this transcript, it seems the NIA is calling this proposed group **'The Consortium.'**

It also seems that +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "")'s hope that +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") back his research remains an open possibility. Time will tell if that hope emerges into reality.
