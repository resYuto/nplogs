Dr. +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "")Â has uncovered a strange map. According to him, the object came to him during his research, and somehow imprinted in his mind so vividly that he was forced to revisit it later despite ignoring it at the time.

**Investigators, your talents and brilliance are needed. What does map mean, and how can it help us?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Martin Schubert</h2>I uncovered this map while conducting research. I ignored it at the time, and continued my work uninterrupted. Later on, I could not get the image out of my mind.<br /><br />It remained in memory so sharply that I had to revisit it and study it further.<br /><br />Even now I'm not sure of what it means, but, almost as if the object is speaking to me somehow, I know it's important.<br /><br /></div>
