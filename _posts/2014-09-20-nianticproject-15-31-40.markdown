Thanks to the work of Agents in Europe last week, coordinated by leading members of the Investigative community, we were able to recover half the slides in a Top Secret briefing about the past, present and future of the AI developed for the Niantic Project, ADA.

I have now been able to obtain this document in full.

The first 6 slides cover ADA's origins as a subset of Machine Learning Algorithms derived from an as of yet undisclosed 'Total Information Awareness' project, and tracks her evolution as she, during the course of intensive analysis at the Niantic Project, grows to become self-aware.
