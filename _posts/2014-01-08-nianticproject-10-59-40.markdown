A message from +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "") came to light today. We haven't heard from her in some time, and I wonder where she's been...

She claims to have received a communication form 'a different place.' The thing with Misty is, her 'gift' is as much an illusion as a truth, she's acknowledged this herself. Given that, it's hard to know how to read that statement.

**What do you make of the cryptic message? Do you think it's truly a communication from another place, as Misty claims, or an illusion created by the mentalist for some purpose we have yet to determine?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, references and speculation.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Misty Hannah</h2>Friends, happy new year.<br /><br />I have something to report. Take it as you may.  I received a communication from a different place.  <br /><br /><i>"When you think you know the truth, you are merely waiting for another revelation. That which is seen is a shadowy manifestation of what is unseen.  Behind each thing known are two things unknown. Behind the symbol is a truth. Behind the truth is a symbol…”</i><br /><br /></div>
