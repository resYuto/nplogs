Hardball.

After receiving the  [#timezero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero "")  package on behalf of the Enlightened, Agent  +[Richard Walden](https://plus.google.com/112217333135124700456 "") uploaded this video, with claims that he has destroyed it in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of the three XM corporations currently competing for control of its contents: +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")  and +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "").

If true, it's a bold move, and one with unknown consequences. From what I can gather, the package contained some kind of visual evidence of symbols, glyphs with great power, that were recovered by +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") from a mine near the Texas/Mexico border. If the lost letters Hank recovered are to be believed, the glyphs may indeed have had influence on those who saw them.

A series of videos uploaded by +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") showed Hank on the run during his journey to retrieve these symbols, being chased by Private Military Special Ops, possibly operatives from Visur, Hulong, IQTech, or all three.

Here is the list of questions running through my mind:

Did +[Richard Walden](https://plus.google.com/112217333135124700456 "") actually destroy the package? Or is this leverage...
Does Hank Johnson have a backup of the contents? Does another copy exist?
Was the courier who transported the package from Paris to London clean, or was she a double agent for someone? If so, who? Do they have a copy of the contents?
Last we heard of Carrie Campbell, she fled from the package handoff at  [#TimeZero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23TimeZero "") . Why couldn't she take it? Was she being followed? Is she safe?

It's been a strange week, that's for sure.
