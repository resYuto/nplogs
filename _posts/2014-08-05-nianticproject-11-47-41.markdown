+[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") reveals that, as expected, +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") has continued to improve her 'Portal Virus' technology and a full scale deployment is imminent.

Although hardened, the Virus remains susceptible to increased XM activity. Schubert's research suggests that by controlling 1 Billion Mind Units, as measured at the end of the upcoming [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomaly in Chicago, Agents may be able to mitigate its effects entirely.
