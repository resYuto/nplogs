*"The opposite of a simple truth is a falsehood, the opposite of a deep truth is another deep truth. In that spirit, let us introduce the concept of a deep falsehood, whose opposite is likewise a deep falsehood."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Frank Wilczek's a pretty brilliant physicist. I recall Kureze mentioning his name a few times during Niantic. Jarvis also spoke highly of him, but I suspect for different reasons.<br /><br />This article crossed my path today. Bit of a brain-teaser (as are all things quantum), but worth the read.<br /><br /><i>"The opposite of a simple truth is a falsehood, the opposite of a deep truth is another deep truth. In that spirit, let us introduce the concept of a deep falsehood, whose opposite is likewise a deep falsehood."</i><br /><br /></div>
