While at Cross Plains, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") was seen with a camera operator interviewing agents and recording his impressions about the Robert E. Howard museum and the strange white glyph that appeared near there. Despite Nomad's difficulties, it seems Hank remains committed to discovering and sharing the truth behind Exotic Matter and its role in human history.

Rumor has it, after shooting for about a day, he left his camera operator behind and went solo into the Chihuahuan Desert, possibly searching for a lost mine guided by a series of previously undiscovered letters. According to his Google+ posts, he wasn't alone, and the people following him out there were armed and dangerous.

Now, +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") has uploaded what I believe is the first of a series of self-shot videos, apparently retrieved by a friend of Hank's via a dead-dropped memory card. They shed more light on Hank's journey into the desert and his hunt for the mine.
