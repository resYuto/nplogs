<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Agent thedeacon1972, a Resistance Agent, had a fairly strong reaction to the letter from Jahan that I shared yesterday. His open response to her is worth reading. He brings to surface some of the issues that have led to a fracturing of the Resistance ideology, in particular its increasingly close association to the N'zeer.<br /><br />‪#‎InvestigateIngress‬<br /><br /></div>
