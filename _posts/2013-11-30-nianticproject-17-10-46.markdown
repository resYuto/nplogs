The trail leads into the past, to Rome, to the heart of the Anomaly.

A compromised NIA transcript of a conversation between +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""), formerly of +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") and most recently seen attempting to convince the Centers for Disease Control to develop an anti-XM vaccine, and Ezekiel Calvin, current head of +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 ""), sheds light on their tense relationship (a byproduct of the betrayal and intrigue in the aftermath of Devra's escape from the Niantic Project facility) and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s role in what's to come.

A recent update from Mr. Johnson revealed that he continues to dig deeper into the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") mystery, and believes that one of the threads he must follow lies in Phoenix, another potentially massive Anomaly site.

After yesterday's revelations, we now know that Susanna Moyer may have had a hand in arranging Oliver Lynton-Wolfe's transport to Buenos Aires.

As Reckoning Day approaches, the chessboard is slowly arranging itself for the two final conflicts.

**Here are the questions at the fore of my mind, in light of all this: Why is Moyer taking a side in the Lynton-Wolfe/Jarvis conflict? Have we heard of the Peshawar Anomaly before? What might it be? If Calvin backs an attempt to build an anti-XM vaccine, what might that mean for the XM Corporation, for Devra's aspirations, and for the relationship between these two influential power-brokers in the world of ****+[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "")****.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, references and insights.
