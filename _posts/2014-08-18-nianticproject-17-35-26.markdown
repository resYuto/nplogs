We have heard multiple times since the +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") Virus emerged that, somehow, ADA may have been affected by the change in the Portal Network.

What was less clear was... why? How?

This leaked NIA transcript seems to finally provide some evidence of ADA's relationship to Exotic Matter and how the recent changes to the Portals may be having an impact on the Algorithm.

What might it mean for ADA if the current XM situation continues? What might it mean for her merger with +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and their long term plans?

A passcode to those who enrich this conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
