It seems Calvin's action against +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""), if the information we previously uncovered was in fact true and not 'part of the setup,' has failed.

I cannot currently verify the veracity of the prior intel about the individual known as Bobby and his relationship with Calvin, but I'll dig deeper.

If it's a setup, we need to know who was really behind it. If it wasn't maybe Calvin is hoping we'll lose his scent in the confusion.
