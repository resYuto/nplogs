Today, another image beamed it's way across the internet and arrived in my inbox. Attached was a short but decisive note **"The last of the first..."**

The last of the first what? I am not sure I've been able to figure that out quite yet... With Operation  [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "")  approaching, my hope is that +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") will resurface to help our understanding grow beyond where we are now...

With what we have now, the final piece in a set of 4 Journal pages (Page 1, Page 2, Page 3), I think we can finally begin to covert ideas into working hypotheses.

**For today's question of the day, let's turn our full focus to Carrie's Epiphany Journal. With these 4 pages, can we now begin to understand what, if any, the message contained within is? Your guess is as good as mine, but I'm hoping that will all our thinking combined, we can arrive at a solid hypothesis.(As always, a passcode reward for thoughtful contributions)**
