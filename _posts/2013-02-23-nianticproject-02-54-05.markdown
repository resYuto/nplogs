855 deplanes and begins life as a new man, and receives further information about his targets.

A scrambled transmission from a portal was received by an Enlightened agent in the field using the Ingress scanner technology.

It seems to be a message from Jarvis, something to do with Klue, a monument, and a time. It's got me worried. I'm still processing the transmission, and I'll have more on it later.
