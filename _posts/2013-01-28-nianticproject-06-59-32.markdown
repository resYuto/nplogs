The decisive moment is just hours away, and there are reports of dozens of agents swarming the site of Cahokia Mounds.

I received an unexpected delivery earlier today, it contained the first page of a document from long ago. One that helps explain Cahokia Mound's significance to Hank Johnson, and why it may have so much control over him.

It seems Johnson was deeply affected by his study of the area's history, and it may have been what led him to become an explorer, a traveler, and a seeker of mankind's lost past.Â 

In addition, it seems the overseers are keen to ensure Hank Johnson's television show can serve the purposes of the Niantic Project.
