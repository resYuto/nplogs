<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Another Portal Clue emerged earlier today. I don't know where it will lead us, but I'm fairly certain that's the Acolyte at the center of the image.

Good hunting.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
