+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") heads south... to the land of the Anazktec.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>The next few days are going to be courtesy of Montgomery. If this is anything like last time, I expect I’ll be riding in transport planes and maybe a supersonic jet, dropping in parachutes and I’ll probably end up spending at least one gruelingly long day in an inflatable river craft.  My journey is going to take me to one of the most obscure corners of the world.  The land of the Anazktec. <br /><br />Expect some radio silence, but I’ll be back online soon.<br /><br /></div>
