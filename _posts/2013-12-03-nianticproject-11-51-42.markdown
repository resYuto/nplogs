What is +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") up to?

This short but revealing piece of surveillance footage was delivered to me earlier today.

Some had speculated that, in the compromised  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "")  video last week, the voice of Hank Johnson could be heard guiding the operative known as 'Mazz.' This video confirms that she was indeed working for him.

**What might Hank's objective have been? Why was Mazz there? To warn or entrap... To help or hurt? With Hank off in pursuit of the history of  ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** , how might what he discovers  be important to the impending collision between Oliver Lynton-Wolfe and Jarvis?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
