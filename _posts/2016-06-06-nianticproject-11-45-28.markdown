<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>I've spend most of this past week trying to follow up on the repercussions of the Enlightened victory at the first Aegis Nova Anomalies. <br /><br />What we knew going in was that the Acolyte wanted to use the XM energy generated by an Enlightened win to launch a plan against ADA. Jarvis was going to reach into Klue's mind and find subconscious patterns left there by the AI. Those patterns, in theory, could be used to discover ADA's weaknesses and develop an attack against her.<br /><br />Based on a few different pieces of information we found this week, it seems the plan was a success.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
