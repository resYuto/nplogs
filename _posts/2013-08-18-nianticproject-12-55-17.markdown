If you were watching earlier today, you saw a corner turned. From overwhelmed and ensnared in an Enlightened Megafield, the Resistance in Washington D.C. turned it up to 11 and claimed the day. After a victory like that, I hope Resistance morale is high. It's proof that under the toughest circumstances, we are nimble, powerful and united.

An NIA tracking document earlier today revealed two conversations between +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") and +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""). While the rumor has been floating around for some days that they are intending to meet in New York, this is the first real confirmation I've received that this is true. A meeting of two eminent researchers and dynamic minds from across the factional divide for unknown purposes. I would like to be a fly on the wall in that room.

Susanna Moyer's daily Burst Report on Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") from Washington D.C. ended abruptly and for unknown reasons. I have no further intel to share on her current status at this time.

**Today, I want to talk about Hank and Devra meeting in New York. What do you think they are up to? Is this some kind of cross-faction peace talks? A conspiracy against Jarvis? Or against the NIA and Phillips? Does Devra even align herself with any particular faction? Her ideology has always been difficult to pin down, and as for Mr. Johnson, he's a renegade and folks like that are always hard to put in a box cleanly. As usual a passcode to all those who join in thoughtful conversation...**

The clock stubbornly clicks down to Manila. Stay safe, Agents.
