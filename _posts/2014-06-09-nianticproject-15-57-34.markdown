+[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") recently shared their opinions on the  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")  and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s fate.

For Klue and ADA, the path is crystal clear, a projection of a future free from interference.

Martin Schubert, as a result of his close work with +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") during the production of Nomad, has perhaps begun to see things more from the viator's perspective.

Not just by merit of being in the same place and time, but because before I joined the Project, I was a proud skeptic. The bar of proof I required was so high that barely an idea was able to make it past my filters. The very opposite of Hank, a man who wandered into barren deserts and untamed jungles based on nothing but a hunch.", "<br />", "<br />", "The funny thing is, I can count more times Hank was right based on those hunches then I was with my mountains of evidence. Life is full of such surprises. Working with him on his Nomad projects has been such a surprise, and a privilege as well.", "<br />", "<br />", "It's difficult to pick sides in the conflict of ideals about XM and its potential for humanity. As a scientist, my instinct is to stand back and evaluate carefully before drawing any conclusions. ", "<br />", "<br />", "But, I accept that there are guides with a gift, buried in their instinct, who can sense the right path forward. Hank's journey over the last few years has caused me to see the amazing advances made by humankind over the last few thousand years in a new light.  Perhaps we did not do this alone.", "<br />", "<br />", "The natural world teaches another lesson as well.  The goal of life is to grow until checked, consuming every available resource to propagate. If, in ADA, we have created such a lifeform, its growth may end in our suffocation.", "<br />", "<br />"], :ignore=>true}}
