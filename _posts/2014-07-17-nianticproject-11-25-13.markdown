Former Niantic Project Researcher, +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 ""), reveals that work has begun to develop a solution to the accelerated Portal Decay caused by Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s Portal Virus.

In the meantime, he believes that raising the combined Global MU level above 700 Million at the end of the first [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomaly may prevent further acceleration, and could in fact reverse some of the Portal Decay changes that have been caused thus far.

[#### photo: Work has just begun to develop a long term solution to the accelerated Portal Decay caused by +Devra Bogdanovich's so-called 'Portal Virus,' but we believe we have determined a method to stall further deployments of this dangerous technology and, perhaps reverse some of its effects as well.
Our research shows that by if the combined Global MU Level is above 700 Million at the end of the first #Helios  Anomaly(^), +Devra Bogdanovich's next planned deployment is likely to fail, and in fact, Portal Decay may begin to decelerate towards its former state.
(^) By the final Checkpoint prior to Measurement 4 - #Helios  - San Diego.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wAFfe53BVAM/U8cjekKjesI/AAAAAAAAAyM/wKhzjOD5U84/w1074-h1401/700Million.png "")
