The strange final moments from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s  aborted Nomad shoot have re-emerged in a new light.

I had heard that Hank's friends at +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") had sent the footage through their analysts. It seems that their work has now produced some results.

+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s words to Hank are troubling,  and it seems Hank heeded them, choosing not to pursue Jahan into the Anti-Magnus nest below the ancient Persian city.

At this moment, the fate of the [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomalies is balanced on a razor's edge, making Devra's warning perhaps even more ominous.

The final [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomaly is about to begin. +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")'s fate, and the success or failure of Jahan's attempt to activate the N'zeer technology hangs on what will unfold in the hours to come.
