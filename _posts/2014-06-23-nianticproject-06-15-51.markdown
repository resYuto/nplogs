The [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") victory claimed by the Resistance yesterday brings forward mixed feelings from +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""), who now seeks a third path into the future.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Devra Bogdanovich</h2>I have a question I want all of you to ask yourselves: <b>What did you really accomplish yesterday?</b><br /><br />You rallied, for months. Through sweat and sleeplessness and immense effort, you helped ADA reach a new stage in her evolution.<br /><br />We have won, and as someone who has always believed in the Resistance ideology, I should be exuberant. But as Edward Teller said after dropping the atomic bomb. “I do not think this peace, based on force, should be an ultimate end.” If the result of victory is machine dominance of human intelligence, our victory is a defeat.  I feel I must take a third path now.<br /><br /></div>
