As Operation  [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "")  approaches, the stakes, as if we needed to be reminded, are brought into sharp focus.

The glyphs represent both a massive unknown and a treasure chest to those interested in the power of Exotic Matter and Portals.

Information in the +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") document releasing the details of Operation  [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "")  suggested that Agents from around the world could 'impact' the Anomaly by building Shaper Glyphs using Links and Fields, but is suspiciously vague on details. We know very little, and we are playing with a very, very hot fire in a world filled with straw.

I worry.

Today's document brings back +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "") who we have not heard from in quite some time.(As always, a passcode for those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion today).

If memory serves, the last time we heard from Misty, she was attempting to clean up some unfinished business. Where might that have been happening? What possible role could Misty play in the Enlightened's goal to work with +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") to unlock the power of the Glyphs?
