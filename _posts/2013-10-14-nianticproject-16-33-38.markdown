+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") emerges from the shadows with a new series of Glyph translations.

He, like I, was transfixed most of yesterday by the chaos and magnitude of Operation  [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") . Its opening Vector was massive, and with Agents around the world attempting to battle for MU simultaneously, resulted in some massive shifts in power across the globe.

**What are your impressions of the impact of these first few Anomaly events? What are your predictions for where Operation  ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")****   might take us in the weeks to come?**

A passcode will be awarded to those who enrich our discussion with meaningful thoughts, references, speculation and ideas.
