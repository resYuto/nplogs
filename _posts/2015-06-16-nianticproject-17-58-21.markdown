According to +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 ""), +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") is headed to the Portland Anomaly, but it's unclear if this is of her own volition.

Her last appearance there was part of a plan by Enlightened Agents to use the Anomaly to affect her, in the hope that she would embrace the cause of the Enlightenment.

Last time, the plan worked.

Could this be the makings of something similar?
