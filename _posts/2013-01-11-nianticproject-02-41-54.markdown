The first chapter of the novel, 'An Exotic Matter,' sent to me earlier this month by someone named Felicia Hajra-Lee has come to a close, and with it, Dr. Bogdanovich reaches Zagreb.

Is the story we have been told fact? Was Devra truly unaware of what waited for Jarvis in Zurich as the pages express?

Felicia told me there was more to the book. I'll be following up with her to see if I can get my hands on it.

In the meantime, all we can do is see if any corroborating evidence can be found.Â
