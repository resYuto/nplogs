Some days ago +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") made an announcement 'Welcoming a New Generation of Elite Agents' and referencing Montreal and July 12th, 2014.

It was unclear at the time, but a recent document from the Asian XM giant has revealed just what they had planned: A new XM Burst Operation structure designed to enable the Factions to leverage and train new recruits in preparation for the next major Anomaly series.

Agents in Montreal, Chattanooga and Toronto... the clock is ticking... Good luck!
