It seems that Jay Phillips finally succeeded in silencing that old thorn in his side, the  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") . 

Or did he?

The broadcast received yesterday indicates otherwise.

With +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") in London for the  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")  Anomaly tomorrow, and another [#IngressReporter](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReporter "") in Flagstaff, it seems the truth remains stronger than the filter.

Let's hope that paradigm remains.
