Here is the third piece from +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")'s talk.

The topic: truth and the nature of science.

It's an important and interesting idea: We are operating in an area where what can be proven, what can be sensed and what must be believed are entwined in a complex and often volatile relationship.

**I am continuing my call for Sitreps from the ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** Anomaly this weekend. In addition to Agent activity Sitreps, I need any and all intel regarding classified material that may have been uncovered, and the fate of the Felicia Hajra-Lee chapter. Thanks, Agent Castanza for filling us in regarding the Dalby performance.**

A passcode to those who enrich our discussion.
