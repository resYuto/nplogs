A captured email from HAZDATA's mobile task-force at the Niantic Facility in Geneva confirms my worst fears...

If ADA has indeed been taken offline, Misty Hannah, who is scheduled to perform live at the Magic Castle this Wednesday, may have lost an important ally. 

There are still some openings available to visit the Magic Castle this Wednesday (April 24) in Los Angeles as Misty Hannah's special guest.

Myself,+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""), +[Thomas Greanias](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902 ""), +[flint dille](https://plus.google.com/115515338091137923278 "") and +[Joe Philley](https://plus.google.com/107179591490960059904 "") will be in attendance.  

Share a story about how XM has shaped the way you think, or share a picture that describes how your life has changed since discovering the world of Exotic Matter. Share it publicly as well as with +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "") and +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") and use the hashtag  [#ingressmagiccastle](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingressmagiccastle "")  to be placed on the list.
