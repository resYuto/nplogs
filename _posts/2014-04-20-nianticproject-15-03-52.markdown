+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") reminisces on his role at the Niantic Project, as well as the nature of [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "").

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>After I was shot my body was dragged into the 13MAGNUS inner sanctum by Azmati. <br /><br />Azmati knew more about 13MAGNUS than he told me.  His family, for generations, had been entrusted with preserving and passing on knowledge of the ritual, going back to the time of Alexander. Azmati knew what he was doing.  By dragging me into the inner sanctum and activating the Dark XM objects there, he saved me, in the best way that he could. <br /><br />He gave me life, but life as a shadow, doomed to walk the Earth in a cycle of 1,331 days, only to perish and be born again, ignorant of what passed since my last birth.  I emerged from the cave in my new form, leaving my body inside, where it must remain, and was evacuated from the area and debriefed.  No one, including Calvin, suspected the truth, although the power of the XM around the site, which froze munitions in mid-flight, likely motivated Calvin to begin what became known as the Niantic Project.  I was recruited into that project and there met many of the people that have had such an enormous impact on my life since including Devra Bogdanovich, Roland Jarvis, Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe, Misty Hannah, and the rest.  <i>(Note: I need to write up thoughts on each of them.)</i><br /><br />My contributions at CERN, were, in a scientific sense, small.  However, two things were clear to me from my college research (<a href="http://goo.gl/GU5X3g" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/GU5X3g</a>) on 13MAGNUS: XM has been felt by humans since the dawn of time and has been responsible for the rise and fall of whole civilizations. This is what I believed happened at Cahokia, Caddo and many of the great civilizations of the old world. <br /><br />My time at Niantic was cut short by a previous commitment to shoot the pilot episode of my television show Nomad (<a href="http://goo.gl/YOaQVx" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/YOaQVx</a>), meaning that I was absent during the crucial events of “Epiphany Night” (<a href="http://goo.gl/BqvHWP" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/BqvHWP</a>) when massive XM exposure transformed the lives of everyone in the lab. <br /><br />My trip to Africa, as documented with my help by Thomas Greanias, let to my deeper understanding of the methods used by ancient civilizations to manipulate XM using stone “resonators” as well as the role played by Dark XM (“Chaotic Matter”), a substance critical to 13MAGNUS rituals.<br /><br /></div>
