x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I can tell you now, that part of my mission in New Orleans was to try and help secure Martin Schubert. We failed, but we did get Lynton-Wolfe, and whatever I might think of him, I can’t deny that he is one of the most important Niantic researchers, if not the most important. I’ll let you debate that point.<br /><br />The other part of my mission was to check out a possible location and see if it might be connected to the place we are now calling <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a>. That location was Avery Island. Unfortunately, it was a dead end. <br /><br />One of the clues driving me there was a rumor that there was another Robert E. Howard manuscript, posthumously edited by his pen-pal Lovecraft (not sure how he got it, possible Howard’s father forwarded some unfinished drafts to him).<br /><br />The rumor is it that the document was in the Weird Tales archives under the pseudonym of Howard Craft, and still other rumors say that it was stolen from a university by treasure hunters. In any case, I failed to find it, and yet, somehow, it conveniently materialized in the days that followed the Anomaly. How? Well, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />Having now looked at it, it does seem that REH was uncannily aware (at least subconsciously) of forces like Anti-Magnus moving through American history.<br /><br />While the lead at Avery Island turned up dry, I won't stop looking. Even if they have been influenced by the Resistance, we still have a chance to save these people, to bring them back as people and not simulacra, and I'm going to do everything I can to help.<br /><br />And as for what I said about Jahan on IR this week. It wasn't a lie. <br /><br /></div>
