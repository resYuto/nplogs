"I have memories of men searching the house and being very near me but passing by.  I lost my concentration for a moment and one of them seemed to see me, but I focused on the mantra again and he walked away...  He seemed confused…"

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2><br /><b>MORE PRACTICAL CONCERN TODAY:</b><br /><br />Police arrived at Jahan’s palace. She sent me to another room where a Guru asked me to sit down across from him. The weird thing is that my memory of what happened next is very blurred. I recall him teaching me a mantra and helping me to meditate. I have memories of men searching the house and being very near me but passing by. I lost my concentration for a moment and one of them seemed to see me, but I focused on the mantra again and he walked away... He seemed confused… I will have to ask Jahan about this.  When my meditation ended, the Guru was gone.  I feel refreshed and centered. Highly aware of all around me.<br /><br /></div>
