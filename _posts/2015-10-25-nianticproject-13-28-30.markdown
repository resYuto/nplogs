+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") made an interesting observation the other day that +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") (who was a staunch member of the Resistance when she was alive) and +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "") (a vocal Enlightened) were like two parts of a systematic whole. A yin and a yang, in some ways.

If that theory was true, it is going to be put to the test.

By claiming victory at the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Flash Shard Anomalies in Zurich and London, the Resistance have gained control of the XM patterns of both these researchers.

How will this change the interplay between them, and perhaps even their relationship? Enoch and Carrie have always functioned as a single unit, their discoveries a result of the collaboration between them...

With both these powerful sensitives in their camp, the Resistance have gained powerful allies today.
