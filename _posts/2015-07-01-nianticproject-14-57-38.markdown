+[Tycho C.](https://plus.google.com/106965960712090580437 "") confirms that he has been working on [#IngressOrigins](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressOrigins "") and denies any collusion with the NIA and Ken Owen.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Tycho C.</h2>Been seeing a lot of folks talking about <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressOrigins">#IngressOrigins</a>.<br /><br />I've been keeping my head low, but yeah, I'll confirm the rumors.<br /><br />Are they visions like last time? Look, even when I was handing out the posters at  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Comiccon">#Comiccon</a>  2012, I had no way to guarantee that what I'd seen was true, for the past, the present or the future. I had a feeling, and I guess it turned out I was right.<br /><br />Maybe it'll be the same this time.<br /><br />As for those of you who think I'm working with the NIA, and this is all some kind of propaganda. Think again. I'm having to watch my back everywhere I go.<br /><br />When you see what I've seen, when you finally read these pages, you'll know why I'm paranoid about what they're capable of.<br /><br /></div>
