The Enlightened held the portal at Cahokia Mounds. What will the net effect of that moment be? Will it be subtle or overwhelming? I don't know the answer, but I am fairly certain we will begin to understand the totality of what has just happened in the days to come.

The document I received today has disturbing overtones. It seems Misty Hannah, after being denied her request to leave the Niantic Facility for Los Angeles, attempted to escape like Devra and Jarvis but failed. She promises a world alight with the fire of Enlightenment.
