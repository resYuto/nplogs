But here it is.", "<br />", "<br />", "Heat wave. Pretty bad one. Been going on a few months, but this weekend it really came to a head. Twenty thousand and one folks decided to turn their airconditioners on. And the grids went down. I lost power around 5pm or so yesterday and didn't get it back until earlier this morning.", "<br />", "<br />", "A forced time-out off the grid.
