Resistance Agents, by controlling a majority of the 58 Portals across Europe identified by the NIA as the source of a 'High-Risk Shaper Threat ,' have successfully minimized the impact of the first Shaper transmission.

+[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") has claimed that the transmission is "an intense burst of energy designed to influence humans who have not yet discovered the path to the Ultimate."

While the exact nature of the Shaper transmission remains debated, it's clear that if Enlightened Agents hope to successfully spread their message, it will be critical for them to maintain control of these Portals during the next two weeks.

**BREAKING UPDATE: News received of updated Transmission Time on July 22, 2014: 948aedbe575920116235b92138b576a6**
