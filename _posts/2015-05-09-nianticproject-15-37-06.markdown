Reports are emerging of the recovery of some kind of message, Â potentially from +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")...

Apparently, a series of Glyphs have been recovered from Portals connected to the  [#LightmanShards](https://plus.google.com/s/%23LightmanShards "") .

I am still attempting to fully piece together all the details surrounding this. I do not believe these 3 Glyphs represent the full message, but I'm not sure how many more are out there yet.

If you have any additional details, please share them. It is my hope that we can recover Lightman's message in full.
