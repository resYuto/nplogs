A respectable attempt to distill what our Investigation has uncovered in the last 2+ years, but you made one critical mistake, Agent +[Andrew Krug](https://plus.google.com/104577088576326284308 "").

Don't buy into the NIA's cover story. +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "")Â is not a game, and the 'story' is simply Ken Owen's devious attempt to discredit the truths that this Investigation has uncovered.
