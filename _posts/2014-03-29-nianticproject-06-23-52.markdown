The 6 final  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Artifacts have emerged into the world.

For either +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), or ADA and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""), the time is fast approaching for them to face the consequences of their path. With the Resistance in firm control of the majority of the Artifacts so far, I worry for Hank Johnson. If left trapped in his current state, I do not know if he will have the fortitude to survive it.

In the meantime, the remaining Artifacts race towards their destiny.

The image comes from Tycho. As many of you suspected, he was the source behind the first image of the Glyphs associated with the Artifacts. As some of you may have heard, he intends to release his new +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Comic series in LA shortly, perhaps at or prior to tomorrow's final  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Anomaly. Details are still emerging, and I'll keep you posted as the facts surface.

In the meantime, I reached out to the best possible option I could for help in understanding the pattern present in the Glyphs associated with the 17 Artifacts: +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "").

The line connecting us was poor, and I was unable to get a hold of him again after we lost the connection... When I asked his opinion of the Glyph sequence, he said *"Each revelation is the opposite of what I would have expected. Aspects {unintelligible... }, transient and finite. How very intriguing."*

I'm left wondering what pattern it is that he's seeing among the Glyphs.
