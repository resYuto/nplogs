+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") unearths another Glyph from the scrawls within the Krakow document.

x <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>An epiphany came over me as I studied the Krakow document. Initially I had ignored this scrawled form... it had too many strokes to be considered a valid Glyph.<br /><br />Then it struck me. It could indeed be a Glyph, but crossed out as if to say 'NO!'<br /><br />I do not yet know what it means, it covers every point on the calibration grid with spokes radiating out from the center.<br /><br />My research into this form continues, but I wanted to share the discovery immediately, for as always, the revelations emerging from this community have often been most thought inspiring.<br /><br /></div>
