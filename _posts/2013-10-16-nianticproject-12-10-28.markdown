A blast from the past indeed, Devra

An interesting document... equal parts nostalgia and revelation.

From the nostalgic point of view, it's a reminder of the days when people like Devra Bogdanovich and Zeke Calvin were reaching out to those who best represented the qualities of being 'a sensitive' to build a new kind of Think Tank, one designed to study a strange and powerful new kind of matter. A strange and almost magical quantum construct that might have the power to shape the mind. This was before things turned dark, with betrayals and murders in the night, and the slowly rising Â mistrust and fear of a global pandemic.

From a revelatory point of view, what I find most fascinating is Carrie and Enoch's synchronized synesthesia. While it's true that many synesthetics experience similar perceptions, I've never before heard of two people who's manifestation of synesthesia was exactly aligned. It reminds me a little bit of the recently discovered Hank and Devra relationship prior to the Niantic Project. They too shared an odd, almost insignificant commonality, and yet somehow arrived at Niantic decades later to play staggeringly important roles.

**For our discussion today, I want to propose an interesting thought exercise, since we are on the topic of Enoch Dalby, Carrie Campbell and Synesthesia... What musicians from the past and the present might be powerful sensitives? If you had to predict their alignment, what might it be? Do you think other musicians and artists share (or shared) a common sensory bond like Enoch and Carrie, who might they be?**

A passcode for those who enrich our conversation with meaningful ideas, references and speculation.
