[#IngressYearFour](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearFour "")<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearFour">#IngressYearFour</a><br /><br />Wrote, deleted and rewrote what I wanted this post to be about a dozen times today.<br /><br />It's four years since I put the first pin in that Investigator Board.<br /><br />At some level, that means a lot. It means places we've been together, discoveries we've shared, mysteries we've solved. Lives we've changed.<br /><br />At some level, it means a little. The journey continues, its velocity and essential energy unchanged, empowered by folks like you.<br /><br />We are on a shared train into the deepest fractal in our universe. Each mystery unfolds to reveal truth and more mystery. Each mountain we climb reveals another distant peak. A challenge for the future.<br /><br />In the end, what I really wanted to say today was two things:<br /><br />1. Thank you. To each Investigator who has joined us, whether for a moment or for the long haul. This is your Investigation. I'm just the guy who runs the website.<br /><br />2. I'll see you again tomorrow. We may be four years in, but the horizon's still somewhere out there, and there's work to be done.<br /><br />Much love and respect.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearFour">#IngressYearFour</a><br /><br />-PAC<br /><br /><br /></div>
