The Resistance and Enlightened collided across the Americas today.

While the Enlightened were victorious, moving 8 Shards of the XM entity Roland Jarvis to the Cupid Span Portal and also controlling the December 14th Anomaly as a whole, the Resistance displayed remarkable shows of force across the day, ensuring the Enlightened had to fight for their success inch by inch.

While this massive collision of force was breathtaking to witness in and of itself, the events that transpired around them were even more mesmerizing.

Discovered partly thanks to Susanna Moyer's live Ingress Report broadcast (viewable here: [INGRESS REPORT | Live In San Francisco - Operation #13MAGNUS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt4wBrREio4 "") ), and partly from witness reports from San Francisco, the rumors tell stories of Hank Johnson disappearing, Portals that broadcast Glyph messages, Roland Jarvis emerging and clashing with Lynton-Wolfe, Klue breaking into a video feed to share an important message and much more.

Members of our own Investigative community provided their expert opinions across the evening to help those watching understand the unfolding events.

**We must catalog and interpret what happened tonight. Were you there? Can you provide a witness account? Did you see it on the livestream and notice something? What transpired this evening, what can we learn from it, and what does it mean for the future.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, references, links and speculation.
