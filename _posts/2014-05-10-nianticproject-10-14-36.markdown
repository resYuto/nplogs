+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares more details about the sections of his newest work on NOMAD that aired in Yesterday's [#IngressReport Raw Feed May.08.2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiKJ93MJ62E&amp;list=PLDEUWItbkQ5_tZylwFJlrO6gKamNW8-SW "") .

Why is +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") using his last remaining days to work on Nomad?

I suspect that much will become clear as the Sante Fe [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") XM Anomaly unfolds.
