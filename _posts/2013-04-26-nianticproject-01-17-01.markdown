Was on-site to support +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "") at her first live performance since Niantic entered our lives. Something ugly went down, I can't be sure, but I thought I heard ADA speak, if so, a huge relief. 

Still piecing the details together using witness accounts, if you remember what happened, share your story using  [#ingressmagiccastle](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingressmagiccastle "") . 

Today, Susanna Moyer returns with the Ingress Report. The top stories:

Niantic Facility Takeover.
Shaper Data Transmission.
Operation Blue Mist.
Rumors of new Scanner upgrades.
and more...
