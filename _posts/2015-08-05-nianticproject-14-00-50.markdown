Some interesting news surrounding +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") today.

If a recent post by +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 "") is to be believed, ADA may have reached out to them in order to speak on their show this Thursday evening.

Meanwhile, +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "") has emerged with new writings that continue to reveal the details of ADA's 'murder,' although it remains unclear if these events have already happened, or if they lie in the future.

Is that why ADA is planning to speak on BTS? To silence (or perhaps confirm) rumors that she is in danger?

Meanwhile, Investigators in +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") have been conducting a mock-trial of the Artificial Intelligence for the crimes she is alleged to have committed, including the murder of +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") and the woman known as Katalena.

It seems to me that ADA is facing a severe shortage of friends at this time...
