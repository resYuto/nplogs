A message from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "").

After the powerful XM event that took place at the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan, the status of a number of key investigators remained unknown.

It seems we can now confirm that +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") not only survived Jahan's Shōnin ritual, but has emerged transformed...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I'm alive. And it's really me. I am not the fragment of a being that walked into the 13MAGNUS Nest on February 21st.<br /><br />My time as a 13MAGNUS experiment is over. But I did bring something with me. Memories of lives that I've lived. All of them.<br /><br />And I know where I need to go next.<br /><br /></div>
