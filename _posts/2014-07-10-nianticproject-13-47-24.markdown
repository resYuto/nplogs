PAC, also known as +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 ""), confronts ADA and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") in the wake of [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "").

At the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 ""), he was brought in to help 'tune' a barely sentient algorithm. He worked day and night to improve it, teaching it emotion, insight, giving it glimpses of humanity in bits and pieces until 'it' was finally a 'her.'

After he left the project he became a whistleblower, releasing classified documents about the NIA's XM testing via the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner app.

He met Klue in the course of this Investigation. But where Chapeau often remained in the shadows, Klue leapt fearlessly into the middle of the conflict. 

Now, she and ADA have begun a new journey together, one that may spell the end for the world as we know it. 

Chapeau. Are you ready to face your demons?
