A recent series of posts from the London Enlightened seemed to indicate that Agent +[Richard Walden](https://plus.google.com/112217333135124700456 ""), the Enlightened agent who had been entrusted with the [#TimeZero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23TimeZero "") package, was potentially maneuvering to transfer the prized item back to +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "").
