+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") weighs in on the absence we have all felt in recent days.

Thank you, +[Hugo Neves](https://plus.google.com/112340902326257285437 ""), for your work in compiling the evidence and helping this investigation come to fruition. [http://padlet.com/Hugo_Neves/mw7cp4uk8h9k](http://padlet.com/Hugo_Neves/mw7cp4uk8h9k "")

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I only met Joe Philley a few times, but it was always good to know that he was out there.  No matter where I was.  Afghanistan, Africa, India, he was out there, coordinating agents, making things happen.  And let me be honest. If I was going into battle, Joe would be on my 'A-Team.'  R.I.P. brother in arms.<br /><br /></div>
