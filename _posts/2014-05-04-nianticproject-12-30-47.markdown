Powermonger or Guru? The idea of +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") morphs from moment to moment. It's difficult to know how to perceive him.

Mazz, an operator closely connected to +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") is heard talking to Roland Jarvis at his 'commune' by the ocean in this surreptitiously captured recording of their conversation. Mazz seeks answers. Her goal? Unknown, for now. 

What is the Ultimate? Is Jarvis' abstract wisdom a foil or a difficult truth? Each of us will have to decide that on our own. For my own part, the jury is still out.
