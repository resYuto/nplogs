Chapeau warned that this was coming.

After the massive XM event at the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan during the first Shōnin Anomalies, news emerged that a number of Niantic Researchers had disappeared, including +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") and Ezekiel Calvin. It seems likely that they weren't the only two to go missing. Now, +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") is attempting to take control of the missing scientists' research data and other personal effects.

Lorazon is right to worry. I sense the competition over these highly valuable resources will heat up fast.
