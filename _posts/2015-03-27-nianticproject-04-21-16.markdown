The Shōnin Anomalies rapidly approach their deciding moment. In the balance hangs the fate of Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""). Admired by some for her idealism, reviled by others for her choices, a new Bogdanovich will emerge at the end of Shōnin. +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") asks: will past sins be forgiven?

The Shards of Devra's identity and consciousness have already travelled over 250,000 km, half the distance from the Earth to the Moon, and Susanna reports on the incredible adventures Agents around the world have shared as they continue their struggle to control the Shards for their Factions. Sitreps from Ireland, Hawaii, South Africa, France, Sweden and Missouri.

Intel has emerged suggesting that +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") will be present at the Shōnin Finale Anomaly in Hanover. His recent posts have revealed that he has been having strange, troubling visions. Images from thousands of years in the past are haunting him. Are they memories, an XM induced dream or madness?

+[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") aka P. A. Chapeau will be present in Pasadena. Susanna Moyer will be on the ground there to attempt to learn more about the mysterious program called Truthseeker which may lie at ADA's core. If a recent NSA transcript is to be believed, Loeb wrote Truthseeker in an impossible trance-like state over 15 years ago.

Changes within the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner during the last few weeks have enabled increased XM Capacity for Agents L9-16. In addition, Missions can now be discovered both on Intel as well as within the Ingress Scanner itself.

The Shōnin Finale Anomalies are just a few days away, on Saturday in Kyoto, with Satellites in Adelaide, Christchurch and Guangzhou, Hanover, with Satellites in Cardiff, Reykjavik and Yekaterinburg and Pasadena, with Satellites in Denver, Lima, and Orlando.

The next Ingress First Saturday is on April 4th. Find more details at [ingress.com/events](http://ingress.com/events "")

As the final moments in Shōnin draw near, to you all: Good luck.
