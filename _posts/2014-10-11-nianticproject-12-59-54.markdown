+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") reveals a name: **The N'zeer.**

They are an idea so aggressively eradicated from myth, history and our collective memory that it's as if they simply never existed.

Hank hopes that his journey will finally bring their story back to light, after millennia of being buried by those who had wished to hide it forever.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>That mysterious force that’s been wiped clean from history and myth has a name: <b>The N’zeer.</b> <br /><br />I believe that the eradication of all memories of the N’zeer was one of 13MAGNUS’s most important missions, but I’m not yet sure why.<br /><br />I believe that learning more about them will unlock a revelation about the greater nature of the Universe, the Portals and the Shapers.  <br /><br />This is going to be a very dangerous journey, because I may be hunted by 13MAGNUS and Anti-Magnus alike.<br /><br />All fear the revelation of this buried secret for their own reasons, but mankind needs to know the truth.<br /><br /></div>
