From amidst a flow of energy and tone, enigmatic voices emerge, they tell our story. Within them are the excitement, tension and release and we experience as Agents.

I don't know who's behind the Dead Drop Project, but in their first broadcast, I hear the truth of the kind of moments that define the Shaping power of +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "").Â 

More is coming, they tell me, and your voice could define the experience we hear next.

I eagerly await.
