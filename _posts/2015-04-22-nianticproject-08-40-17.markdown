+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") returns to the Anazktec village carrying a disturbing insight.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Returned.<br /><br />Was it a dream? I cannot remember what was real and what was not.<br /><br />There were etched histories on the walls...  They matched histories of the Anazktec.  Did not see bodies, but I believe the Anazktec to be simulacra.  I look around, and I only see 13 of them. Five Men. Five Women. Three Children. Was it always like this? Why did I never notice before? They might be a Magnus. Recursed for millennia. Using their bodies to hold memories along with the walls... I do not know the nature of the site.<br /><br />The Anazktec learned much about me. They seem to fear me. It is getting dangerous.<br /><br />Must get to LZ before things go bad.<br /><br /></div>
