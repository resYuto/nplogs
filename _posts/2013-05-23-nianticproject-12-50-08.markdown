Leaked surveillance footage of the NIA boat tracking myself and Klue on the night of Operation: Bowstring.

In addition, a message from +[ben jackland](https://plus.google.com/100845558813143264405 "") went up earlier today on his profile... it seems that while Susanna remained neutral after the XM anomaly, Ben Jackland received an illuminating transmission.

+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s novel, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).

A continued reminder that investigators planning to be in Cross Plains, TX to witness and study the anomaly taking place on June 7th and 8th should pre-register for Howard Days ASAP ( [http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854](http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854 "") ).
