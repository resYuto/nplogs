From Oakland, +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports on the culmination of the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomaly Series.

Over the course of the day, Agents joined the struggle to control the fates of +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") (in Okinawa), +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") (in Milan) and the master of secrets, Ezekiel Calvin (in Oakland). The Resistance claimed the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Series as a whole with a razor-thin margin, binding the fate of every lost Niantic Researcher.

From high-octane GoRuck challenges, to tactical boat and sky operations, to cluster teams numbering in the tens of thousands across the world, the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Finale was a spectacle to behold. Join Susanna as she covers the epic adventure, as well as other incredible operations like [#BILLIONER](https://plus.google.com/s/%23BILLIONER "")$, Green Snow and Blue Cedar II.
