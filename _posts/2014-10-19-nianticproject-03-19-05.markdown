This leaked intel emerged very recently. It reveals that the  [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "")  Anomalies may be... somehow... interacting with the 'beacons' creating by the  [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "")  Artifacts. I don't think it's fully understood yet exactly what is happening here, but the fact that the beacons may be in some way reacting to the Anomalies is... interesting... and perhaps troubling.

This is developing. I don't think we're in a position to see the full picture yet.

I'll keep an ear to the ground. Stay tuned.
