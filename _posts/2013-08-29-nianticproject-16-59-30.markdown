While I expected to hear from +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "")  (and I still haven't), I'm not surprised that Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe is off the grid.

By robbing +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") and engaging with the Enlightened on the day of the [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") Anomaly in Washington D.C., he effectively burned all his bridges. He then set the ashes alight by taping a statement to his fellow Enlightened that further marked him a damaged, unstable man.

**The question that must be asked is, how valuable is this man? Valuable enough that people like Ezekiel Calvin would be willing to overlook his obvious instability? Despite my less than fond feelings for him, I recognize that he is a savant. His virtuosity in XM technology research and engineering is unparalleled, and frankly I wouldn't be surprised if he had been picked up by the likes of Hulong or Visur. What do you think?**

A passcode as always to those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion.
