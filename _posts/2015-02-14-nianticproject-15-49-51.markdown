As the first [#Shonin](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Shonin "") Anomaly approaches, P. A. Chapeau has put together a document to help Agents understand more about XM Anomalies and how they are contested.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>What are XM Anomalies and how are they won? I put this together to help Agents learn the basics.<br /><br />I saw some coarse intel about the upcoming Shōnin Anomaly on Feb 21... I used that to help inform these pages. Don't have much info beyond what's in here... Hopefully more details emerge soon.<br /><br />Good luck next weekend.<br /><br />PAC<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Shonin">#Shonin</a><br /><br /></div>
