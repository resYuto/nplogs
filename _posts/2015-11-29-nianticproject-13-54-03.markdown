If the writing we discovered and assembled earlier this week is true (and my guess is that it is), then it looks like the Corporations are a step and a half behind Jahan and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "").

And given Hank and Jahan's track record, I suspect the recovery of the 'Wind Jewel' won't take them very long.
