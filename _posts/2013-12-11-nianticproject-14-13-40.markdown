13MAGNUS has always had roots in the ancient, hasn't it?

Despite the heavy hand of the censor, certain key pieces of information emerge from this archival document recovered today. The most compelling of which, is the line: *"There was an underground laboratory there which appeared to be an ancient structure of some sort that had been modified for scientific purposes."*

**If true, is it possible that what Dr. Lynton-Wolfe is attempting in Buenos Aires is neither something new nor the opportunistic exploitation of technology left over from past wars, but the final move in a chess game that has been playing out for centuries? What evidence supports this theory?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
