Klue is back, and she's discovered something interesting...Â 

I tried to get confirmation from my other sources. It seems the codes are definitely beginning to hit the west coast of the USA, and will probably spread to the east coast as well in time. No confirmation yet on how frequently the codes appear, or what Hint Water's relationship to Exotic Matter might be... As Klue said, the brain is 70% water...
