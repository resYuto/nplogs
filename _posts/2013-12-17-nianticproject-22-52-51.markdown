See Mr. Zokiev's document for the details: [http://goo.gl/4eYC9](http://goo.gl/4eYC9 "")

In brief:

A document received by a Niantic researcher named Curter Zokiev brings news of a mission on April 21 to move seven packets of data from Geneva to the following cities in Europe: Zurich, Stuttgart, Munich, Milan, Monaco, Berlin and Paris.

The transmission window will open on April 21 at 2:31:00 PM CEST, and last until 8:30:59 PM CEST.

Link chains created from the specific portals in Geneva to specified portals in the destination cities will be capable of transmitting the Shaper packets any time during that window.

At 8:31:00 PM CEST a special packet will be broadcast along the longest single link connected to either portal in Geneva, and will hold the value of two packets.
