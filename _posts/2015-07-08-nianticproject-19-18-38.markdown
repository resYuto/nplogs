+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") confirms that she will be in San Diego this week, where Comic-Con 2015 is about to begin.

Her exact purpose for being there remains unknown. She mentions 'an important meeting' and requests help in maintaining anonymity, but no further details.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>I can’t say much about why I’ve been off the grid since Portland, but yes, I am headed to San Diego and Comic-Con, and I need your help. ADA has been tracking my every move.<br /><br />We have gone our own separate ways, but she still hovers around me, enveloping me in her perception. Perhaps it's not just her...<br /><br />I am putting myself in a vulnerable situation. Any help you can provide in baffling her recognition algorithms would be deeply appreciated.<br /><br />I will report more when I can. I have a very important meeting.<br /><br /></div>
