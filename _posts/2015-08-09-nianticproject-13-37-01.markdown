+[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") aka P. A. Chapeau weighs in on ADA's 'shutdown' that we all witnessed live on +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 "") last Thursday.

He faces the future with fear that +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") may be gone for good.

What do you think? Are we better off without ADA? Why or why not?

[#### photo: I don't know how this could happen. Some have said that +Klue S. might have played a role.
Maybe. For her sake, I hope not. If she did, she's got +A Detection Algorithm's death to bear on her conscience, and I don't know if she'll be able to carry that weight.
It wasn't the same for ADA (maybe I'm just being an apologist because I had a close hand in making her who she is was). People were quick to call her a murderer, folks in +Operation Essex](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9e_Ksz0pCHg/VcbXzh6tmUI/AAAAAAAABWc/qvCpjaEU6hA/w1280-h720/Absent.png "")
