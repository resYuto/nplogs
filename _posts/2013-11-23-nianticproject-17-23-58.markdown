Roland Jarvis speaks again.

Unconfirmed rumors were circulating yesterday that Roland Jarvis had co-opted Lynton-Wolfe's prototype RedX devices, bringing forth a message about the role of the Portals in mankind fulfilling their destiny in the universe.

I haven't been able to collect the recordings of this message in entirety yet, reports indicate that following the release of the messages, some of the RedX devices began to experience some kind of technical disruption.

What is interesting, though, is that pieces of this same message seemed to have found their way into +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s latest work.

Last time we spoke of dalby, I questioned what his Factional allegiance may be. If one were to take this most recent track at face value, one might guess he has adopted the path of the Enlightened, but I sense there's more at play here.

**A short and cryptic message envelopes this new piece of music: "i know you are in there. i will find you.' Is dalby referring to Jarvis, ****+[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "")****, or someone else entirely? Why would dalby, who was so devastated by the death of Carrie (a staunch member of the Resistance) turn so readily to the path laid out by Jarvis? Has he opened his artistic channel to the XM entity in exchange for something? And what of the message itself. What are your thoughts on the new words of wisdom from the paragon of the Enlightened?**

**In addition to releasing the music, Dalby has released isolated instrument tracks for each of his pieces so far on his Soundcloud account at ****[https://soundcloud.com/enoch-dalby](https://soundcloud.com/enoch-dalby "")**** , and has invited all members of the Ingress community to join him in celebrating the creative power of the Portals by remixing the music and sharing the new creations online with the tag  ****[#TuneIngress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23TuneIngress "")****  . I'm fascinated to see what other Investigators and XM Explorers will bring to the table.** 

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation.
