From what I've learned, production on +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s episode of NOMAD about the important and history of [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") has been abandoned following a strange incident that occurred on set.

While I cannot confirm this, I have heard cursory intel that Hank's friends at +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")Â are currently studying the raw video and audio from this shoot at his request, in an attempt to learn more about the strange incident that took place.

It's unclear exactly what Hank Johnson saw that has him so spooked, but from what I hear, it has made him abandon the decision to proceed to Persepolis and face Jahan.

This is developing.
