This time last year, Agents tapped into Ancient Power spots, building Links to Cross Plains, TX in order to help affect the outcome of an Exotic Matter Anomaly that was centered  there. While at that Anomaly, a large shape was discovered on the ground that would later be understood to be the Shaper Glyph for "Creativity." This set off a chain of events that resulted in the revelation of an entirely new language and way of thinking.

It's been at the front of our minds that +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") Day approaches. And given his relationship to Cross Plains, TX, home of the sensitive author Robert E. Howard, it's safe to assume that this connection may become active again. 

The exact details are yet to emerge, but there's been increased chatter related to Cross Plains in the intel community this week, and that's usually a sign.

I suspect we'll be discovering, very soon, just how Cross Plains may be critical to Hank Johnson's future.
