Some days ago, in the wake of a transcript revealing that NL 1331 (aka +[November Lima](https://plus.google.com/108660770529072226626 "")) had gone missing, Investigators began speculating that the true issue at hand may be a growing rift between the NIA and Niantic Labs... today's intel confirms this.

The connective tissue between them is dense and subject to much speculation. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on where this relationship came from, and where it might be headed...
