A terse, perhaps even evasive response from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") regarding the incident at Jahan's haveli.

Unusual for Hank to be so cagey. I wonder what this might mean. 

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>There’s been a lot of talk flying around about what I did or did not do at Jahan’s haveli. <br /><br />The simple answer is that PA was accurate, I shut it down using a Prime XM Artifact I acquired from a location and in a manner that I will not disclose at this time. <br /><br />I encountered opposition and neutralized it. <br /><br />I could not swear to what the source of the hostile fire was and didn’t stick around long enough to identify those pulling the triggers. <br /><br />That’s all I have to say on the subject and all I am likely to say in the near future.<br /><br /></div>
