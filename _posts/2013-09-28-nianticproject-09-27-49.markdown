Here is the document that was revealed by the  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "")  yesterday. I wanted it to be verified by a few additional sources before releasing it, and thanks to Susanna's help, that has now happened.

A number of Investigators, in particular Agents +[Anthony Castanza](https://plus.google.com/106659698189802662704 ""), +[Owen Johnston](https://plus.google.com/117738441461289511785 ""), +[Jaredo Wens](https://plus.google.com/100199463603847137126 "") and +[Sonny Lee](https://plus.google.com/110159431272374626617 "") (with the assistance of many other agents, including +[Jonathan Roemer](https://plus.google.com/105778793545951234272 ""), +[Daniel Beaudoin](https://plus.google.com/116675615740217671707 "") and +[Storey Redshaw](https://plus.google.com/110871731521065367776 "")) were able to analyze the data from this document as well as an information stream injected into yesterday's Ingress Report and propose a working hypothesis:

**Dates and Locations: A list of potential anomalies that might be coming in the very near future.**

Armed with this theory, I approached a number of trusted sources for verification. The hypothesis was correct.

Here is a list of Emergent XM Anomalies based on the work of our Investigative community and verified by highly-placed Intelligence sources:

**OCTOBER 12, 2013**
Los Angeles, CA - San Jose, CA - Bangkok, Thailand

**OCTOBER 26, 2013**
Seattle, WA - Kiev, Ukraine

**NOVEMBER 2, 2013**
Atlanta, GA - Madrid, Spain - Mumbai, India

**NOVEMBER 16, 2013**
Dallas, TX - Vienna, Austria

**DECEMBER 7, 2013**
Phoenix, AZ - Rome, Italy

**DECEMBER 14, 2013**
San Francisco, CA - Buenos Aires, Argentina

My sources also indicated that while the data suggests that these sites represent Primary manifestations of an XM anomaly, secondary locations may emerge as the data is analyzed more deeply.

**[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")****: *****"The mission of 13MAGNUS is to monitor the effects of mindhacking Obviously, this will be done with the highest of security to make sure that the ideas do not contaminate or threaten humanity..."***** I'm where you are when it comes to understanding what the scope or history of this is. If you have speculation as to what ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** is or might be connected to, I welcome all ideas to the discussion.**
