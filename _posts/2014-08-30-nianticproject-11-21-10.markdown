Former Niantic Researcher, +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 ""), argues for his desire to research the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts. Enlightened ideologue, +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""), struggles through his illness and grasps for lucidity, warning him to turn away... 

Despite the fog of confusion and weakness Jarvis is speaking through, the warning is clear.

A portion of this surveillance audio file was initially obtained by the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""). I have now obtained and present this file in full. It is my hope that all members of the Investigative Community can come to their own conclusion about the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts: Their potential for good in restoring the Portal Network as well as whatever unspoken danger they may represent.
