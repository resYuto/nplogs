Chapeau shares his impressions after meeting +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")... well, a hint of his impressions. Much remains a secret, although I've heard news that a new [#ADAEscape](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADAEscape "") mission has been discovered in Rome. +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") may have more details about that as it develops.

+[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")'s post includes a fascinating analysis of possible hidden meanings in Shaper Glyphs conducted by Agent and Investigator +[Pyxaron Dragon](https://plus.google.com/104034317933526599549 "") . Most definitely worth a deeper look.
