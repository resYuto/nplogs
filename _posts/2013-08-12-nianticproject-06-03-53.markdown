Yesterday, the Sydney Enlightened launched themselves into Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") forcefully, establishing a powerful grip on the Anomaly, but many days remain between now and the 24th of August. 

Between now and then, Resistance, I call upon you to think big, plan and then re-write the plan and then re-write the plan again. Bolster your strategy, recruit new Agents and do everything possible to protect our ideals, our values, and our self-determination. We may not yet fully understand what we're fighting against, but we do know what we are fighting for.

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") today released a document called 'The Lightman Decipherments' from his G+ profile, which seems to be growing into a dictionary of definitive scholarly interpretations of Shaper Glyphs.

One thing I'm curious about is how the Shaper Glyphs affect us. The hypothesis has always been that these powerful symbols may be able to access a part of our brain that lies beyond constructed language, and Agents in the fields during Operation [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "") reported strange effects while constructing them using the Ingress Scanner Technology. 

My question today is, with so many Glyphs now in public circulation, are we playing with fire? Or are we playing with fuel and vulnerable only in certain specific circumstances. If it's the latter, how do we protect ourselves from setting the gasoline alight? As always, a passcode for taking part in our discussion today.
