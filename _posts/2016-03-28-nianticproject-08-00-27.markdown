<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Agents, we’re hurtling towards a moment of truth. In just under a week, the Resistance and the Enlightened… Jahan and the Acolyte… Anti-Magnus and 13MAGNUS… and possibly even the N’zeer and the Shapers will go head to head in a struggle that will span the globe, all to determine the fate of the Obsidian Shield. Are you prepared for that battle?<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
