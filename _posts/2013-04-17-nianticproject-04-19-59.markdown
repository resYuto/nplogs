When the Niantic Project closes its doors, what will happen to the researchers who have discovered this new layer within our reality?

Will they move away from the work that has occupied them so intensely? Will they begin to collaborate among themselves, or branch away as individuals?

In this calibration video, Carrie Campbell discusses her work at Niantic, and her desire to uncover the root linguistic mechanics of the Shaper Mind interaction.

I'm curious if she'll be able to continue her work after Ni closes the doors and locks them shut.
