Hank discovers his host's well kept library, rich with ancient Indian texts and tablets, and begins to explore.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Jahan showed me her grandfather’s library. Texts, scrolls, tablets, photographs, slides -- everything in beautiful condition… a priceless collection, probably acquired over many generations. Learning a bit about the ancient Hindu cosmology, but my knowledge is sorely lacking. I am relying on Jahan to inform me. She’s a better teacher than I am a student. Patient, I think in some ways surprised and pleased that a foreigner would be so interested in such an obscure collection. <br /><br />Feeling better. She assures me that I am safe here, but it’s likely she doesn’t understand the severity of the threat. I upload in bursts.  I am grateful to all of you in your help with my journey and most recent escape. The mere dissemination of the sitreps of those following me is likely to have disrupted them. Provided me a hole to run through.<br /><br /></div>
