They are calling it 'International Dead Drop Day.' [#deaddropday](https://plus.google.com/s/%23deaddropday "")

The folks at VI reached out to me, and it seems they've been busy. Today, they plan to release all previously undiscovered Tycho storyboards in a series of drops from Japan to Hawaii the long way around the globe. I have yet to hear how they managed to get their hands on them... Over twenty drops in total, with nearly 100 Ingress Scanner Activation Codes up for grabs.

In addition to activation codes hidden in the drops themselves, the folks at VI have offered 1 additional activation code to whoever posts their discovered dead drop on Google+. So, fellow investigators, good hunting!Â
