Who holds the key to the past?

Following new revelations this week, some believed that +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 ""), an Astrophysicist who grew up in the company of an uncontacted tribe in South America, may have been Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe's source of information into the Dark XM stockpile in Buenos Aires.

The former Niantic Project member denies the allegations in a post on his Google+ profile.

**Who then, controls the key to the past? Who would be in a position to know about all these buried secrets? And why are they helping Oliver Lynton-Wolfe attempt to destroy Roland Jarvis?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.

**DECEMBER 14, 2013**
San Francisco, CA - [http://goo.gl/Xw9tfD](http://goo.gl/Xw9tfD "")
Buenos Aires, Argentina - [http://goo.gl/vRBu4j](http://goo.gl/vRBu4j "")<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Yuri Alaric Nagassa</h2>I know that there are those of you who suspect that I leaked the information about Jörmungandr and Dark XM to Lynton-Wolfe.  It is not true.  Not on purpose, anyway.  I have been searching my mind for some slip of the tongue.  But I did not know the specifics of the Wunderwaffe program.  <br /><br />When I was young, my father would occasionally take me into Buenos Aires.  He had unspecified business there.  I wandered the days trying to escape my bodyguards, but I did not see the location of Jörmungandr or the Wunderwaffe.  <br /><br />The Anazktec spoke of a giant sea monster that lives in a cave under Buenos Aires.  I found them interesting even as a child, because the Anazktec have never seen the ocean.  Perhaps the legend was true and this cave was the location of the Jörmungandr operation.<br /><br />This legend led me to suspect that there is an information chain that passes to even the uncontacted, and maybe there are more groups who hide in the shadows of civilization.  I suspect further that they are tribal remnants of those civilizations which fell victim to what we call the Shaper Self Destruct Code.<br /><br /></div>
