Will you survive this moment, +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")?

The activity of today's vector of Operation [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") have culminated in a Resistance victory.

As Reckoning Day approaches, both Factions are entwined in a race to move the Shards of Roland Jarvis towards their destiny. The 13th and Final shard is expected to manifest in the Portal Network as a result of today's events.

The fate of the Jarvis Entity is not all that hangs in the balance. This +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") document, obtained today, shows the cost that XM Researcher and occasional independent thinker may have to bear as the cost of her betrayal of the European Technology corporation +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""). 

**The question is, what does it mean to be Ilya Pevtsov's enemy? Do we believe he would resort to violence, and if so, does Devra have the resourcefulness, having burned so many bridges, to survive that threat? Is she trapped, or does she have a way out? And finally, what might the Jörmungandr be, and how is Yuri Alaric Nagassa connected?**

As Operation [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") enters its final week, I wish the Agents who have tasked themselves with carrying this massive responsibility on their shoulders good luck. 

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
