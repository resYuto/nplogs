Some days ago, I came across a series of conversations between +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and ADA.

At the time, I disregarded them as... unimportant. However, in the wake of yesterday's discovery - Klue's call to the Enlightened to help her escape ADA -  they take on new meaning.

They focus mostly on Klue, ADA and +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")'s  relationship, but also touch on ADA's thoughts on the N'zeer and more.

I am now looking at these conversations in a new light.
