A most intriguing piece of information emerged this week. The Japanese financial group, MUFG, has apparently been developing a new kind of XM technology.

Building off the existing XM Capsule, they have combined that technology with unique knowledge they have learned from their vast experience growing financial assets.

This is a section of a document that was circulated to key shareholders at a recent meeting. I have redacted the names of the researchers working on this project for their own protection. The document describes the MUFG Capsule, the world's first interest-bearing XM Object, in fascinating detail.
