On Friday, Agents in Washington DC worked tirelessly to recover a message that Nigel Moyer had passed to +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""). Hank had recruited a group of committed and trustworthy Agents to attempt to recover the package from a contact at DARPA. 

They succeeded, and the package was delivered to +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") at the  [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "")  Anomaly this Saturday.

There were reports that Hank's contact at DARPA may have been compromised. It is not yet known if the contents of the package were compromised as well.

I am working to recover what this package contained. From what I've been told, the Agents who took part in this mission documented its contents in order to ensure that the truth could be revealed if the message could not be delivered to Susanna.

Reports suggest the package comprised of a letter as well as some form of signal intercepted by the ECHELON program decades ago.

If you have more information, please share what you know.
