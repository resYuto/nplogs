Disappointed, and undoubtedly worried, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") promises to continue the Enlightened struggle in the days to come.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>This is not over.<br /><br />The Resistance may have claimed victory over <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Shonin">#Shonin</a> yesterday, but our struggle, the Enlightened struggle, is not over.<br /><br />The N’zeer represent a future without color, without joy, without mystery. Every Agent who sees the beauty of Enlightenment will stand in your way. So cherish what you've accomplished.<br /><br />And to Jahan, whose agents are undoubtedly watching, I have this to say: I will return to Persepolis to finish what I started.<br /><br /></div>
