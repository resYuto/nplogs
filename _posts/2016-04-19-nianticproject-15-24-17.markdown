<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>An update from Oliver Lynton-Wolfe on the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressPortalSurvey">#IngressPortalSurvey</a> experiment. He intends to continue to gather data until the end of Wednesday. I mentioned yesterday that I was in awe of how fervently Agents around the world have contributed to this experiment. It seems OLW shares many of my sentiments.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
