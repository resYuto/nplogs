The first [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomalies are just a few days away, beginning in Bratislava and Washington DC this Saturday. At the heart of this conflict is the fate of +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), XM Researcher and Glyph Expert, who appeared in the Portal Network as Shards just a few weeks ago. 

Agents around the world share their incredible stories: Sitreps from Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, France and Romania are featured.

Later today, +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") will also be on the Agent-run show to shed light on his work with +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") and the program known as Truthseeker.

+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") will be in Washington DC this weekend, where Agents taking part GoRuck Spec-Op training exercises will gain access to high- priority Volatile Portal intel.
