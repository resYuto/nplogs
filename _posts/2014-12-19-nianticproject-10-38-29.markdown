+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports from Charleston on the largest Anomaly in [#Ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Ingress "") History, the [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Finale on December 13th. Across the world over 12,000 Agents took part, with over 5000 just in Tokyo.

The Enlightened began the day strong, taking Tokyo, Manila and Auckland, but the Resistance were quick to take the reigns back. They controlled Barcelona, Charleston and most of the Satellites connected to those cities. The [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Anomaly series came to an end in a sweeping Resistance victory.

Across the [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Anomalies, the Resistance have been working to activate the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Beacons and send a series of homing signals to a force known as the N'zeer. 

With the [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") series now firmly in their grasp, the stage is set for the return of this ancient and powerful force, hidden from humanity for thousands of years by the Shapers and those who worked to support them.

+[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "") has spoken openly about his hope that the coming of the N'zeer will bring forth new knowledge, power and, for some, profit.

Some Agents reported received a secret message from +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") while at Charleston, but this has not been confirmed.

Meanwhile, +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") recently announced that in conjunction with AXA, the global leading insurance group, they had created a new type of rare and powerful Portal Shield, called the AXA Shield. Earlier today, Agents reported encountering these XM objects from around the world.
