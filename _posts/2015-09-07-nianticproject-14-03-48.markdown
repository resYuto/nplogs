+[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "")Â has been suspiciously silent for some time. Are they planning something?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Take this with the grain of salt it deserves.<br /><br />Some contacts who are more wired into the grey/black hat world than I am told me that there's been some aggressive recruiting going on in that circle.<br /><br />According to one of my guys, both the words 'Omnivore' and 'NIA' were being thrown around in private discussions, and what's more, apparently a couple of the folks who had already been recruited were flown by private jet to a major, Chinese, coastal city.<br /><br />Like I said, take this for what it's worth. Cyber-warfare's nothing new in the intelligence community, but at the same time, this may be something to keep an eye on.<br /><br /></div>
