[#IngressObsidian](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressObsidian "")  Seattle Shards: 13 Shards uncaptured. Enlightened lead 31 to 10.Â 

Not a second to spare... Just one Jump Window after the previous report the Enlightened have taken control of 9 additional Shards. The Resistance were able to capture 3 additional Shards at that Jump Window. 13 Shards are live and contested in the Anomaly Zone, and 18 Shards have yet to emerge. All eyes on Seattle.
