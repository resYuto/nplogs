The first of the three Misty anomalies is over. The Resistance have taken this one.

Massive blocking links both near and far prevented either faction from being able to form a field, it came down to a portal count. The Resistance led 8 to the Enlightened's 7.

Dronenet Deployments were retrieved by both factions, and Dead Drops were recovered in NY and SF, LA dead drops currently unconfirmed.

One down, two remain.
