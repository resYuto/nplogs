Here is the remaining portion of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s NOMAD special, created in advance of the Santa Fe and Ishinomaki [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") Anomalies for last week's [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "").

Why have many civilizations of the past faded, suddenly, into oblivion? Are the Portals the garden or the tenders?

What's clear is that both +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") and +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") believe that the two are intertwined, closely, and that human destiny is shaped by the interaction between them.
