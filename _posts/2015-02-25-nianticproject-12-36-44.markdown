+[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") is dead, but the Enlightenment remains. She is his Acolyte, and she comes bearing a warning.

The Anti-Magnus leader, Jahan, set an intricate plan into motion. She tricked +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") into helping her uncover a powerful XM Artifact called the Shōnin stone, then took him and his long-time ally, Azmati, as her captives. 

Jahan forced them to lead her to the 13MAGNUS Nest, an ancient Portal in the Afghan Mountains where Hank Johnson's body lies.

With the help of Resistance activity during the first Shōnin Anomalies, Jahan hoped to conduct a ceremony that would pave the way for the arrival of the N'zeer.

But something went very wrong.
