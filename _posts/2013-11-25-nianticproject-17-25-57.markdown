+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") brings the meaning of another Glyph forward thanks to +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s most recent piece of music.

Seeing the interplay of these Sensitives got me thinking...

Early in the Niantic Investigation, the key Sensitives worked within the envelope of the NIA's Niantic Project in Geneva, Switzerland. Collectively, they unlocked both the technological capacity of Exotic Matter, as well as many of its other more qualitative aspects, +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "")'s visions of symbols and meanings, +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s music, +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "")'s 'sometimes not an act' visions and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s dowsing-rod-like sense for ancient powerspots.

Then, the Project fragmented. The corporations, hungry to seek strategic advantage, took aboard the key scientific researchers, people like Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") and Oliver Lynton-Wolfe.

**It seems now that a new status quo needs to emerge (or, perhaps it has already?). How do the remaining scientific researchers who began their journey with the Niantic Project fit into these two new ecosystems: The technological, sponsored by the corporations and serving to enhance the Ingress Scanner Technology and forward the XM arms race, and the qualitative, slowly and surely unlocking the mysteries of the Ordered Data pattern, the mystery of the Shapers and the complex interaction of both of these with the human past, present and future. How do you see the remaining Niantic Researchers fulfilling roles in our path forward as these two ecosystems seem to emerge, or perhaps, is there a different status quo emerging altogether?** 

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation today.
