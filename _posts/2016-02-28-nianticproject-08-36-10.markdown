[#IngressObsidian](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressObsidian "") Seattle Shards: 24 Shards uncaptured. Enlightened lead 38 to 10.Â 

Just over an hour remains in this Anomaly, and the Resistance effort seems to have stalled. They have been unable to acquire any additional Shards across the last 3 Jump Windows. The Enlightened, meanwhile, have raised their count to 38. However, the final set of 18 Shards has just entered the fray. Perhaps it will help turn the tide.
