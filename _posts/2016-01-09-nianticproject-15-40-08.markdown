Thanks to the clue received yesterday and the excellent work of Agent +[Izik Avinoam](https://plus.google.com/107515286503311404000 ""), this fragment was recovered at a Portal in Jerusalem. It appears to be part of a translated document called *'The Explorations of Obsidius.'*

I suspect, as more fragments of this document are recovered, we will begin to learn more about this individual and how he connects to what +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") called the Circle of Obsidius.
