Calvin forces his undercover operative at +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") onto a razor-thin ledge. He wants more Dark XM for +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""), and fast.

Why? As the saying goes: The Devil you know...

With Antoine Smith and Catherine Fan already hunting for a traitor in their midst, it's a dangerous move in a game with lethal stakes.

As a man, Jarvis has a time and a place: limitations. Within the Portal network, he becomes an uncontainable force. The desperation behind Calvin's move is an indicator of the fear and unknown potential Jarvis represents.
