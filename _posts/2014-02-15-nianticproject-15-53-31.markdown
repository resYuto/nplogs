On the eve of the first [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") Anomaly, a familiar figure has quietly reemerged. Where will his visions take us?

I received this from an anonymous source earlier today... It seems Tycho has been working on another glimpse into the Present at a different time.

**What do we know of Tycho? Why does he remain so deeply in the shadows, and what will his new art reveal? What do we expect to emerge from the  ****[#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")****  Anomaly tomorrow? Is Tycho somehow connected to it? Will Hank or Mazz surface, or are they too clever to get caught.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
