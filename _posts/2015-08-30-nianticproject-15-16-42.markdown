Does Quantum Entanglement explain how what lies beyond the Portals interfaces with our reality?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>At times like this I wish Kureze was still around.<br /><br />Einstein might be turning in his grave, but Kureze would have been jumping for joy.<br /><br />If nothing else, (and a strong reminder here that I am not a physicist), the entangled nature of the universe is proof that much of what we perceive as reality can and probably does connect to some other facet of it that we cannot see.Â <br /><br />Is that what lies beyond the Portals?<br /><br /></div>
