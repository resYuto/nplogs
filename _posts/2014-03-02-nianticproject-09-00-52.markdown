[#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") 03

Congratulations, Resistance, on your massive victory today.

The Resistance have managed to take control of every Anomaly in [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") so far.  But the Enlightened have wrested control of both Artifacts.

Could this be a gambit?

More Recursion Artifacts will emerge this week.

Good luck to Agents from both Factions.
