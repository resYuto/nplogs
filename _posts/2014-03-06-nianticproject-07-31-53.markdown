The Resistance have captured the first  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Artifact.

With two more having arrived on US soil late yesterday, the temperature is beginning to rise.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2><br /><b>Creativity</b> has been acquired. The first <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion">#Recursion</a> Artifact is ours.<br /><br />Thank you, Resistance Agents. I was never worried about your commitment to this important cause. There is much work still to do, but I know that you will achieve this important mission.  <br /><br />My survival is at stake.  But not only that.  This is also about shaping our future as a species, a future free of outside interference.<br /><br /></div>
