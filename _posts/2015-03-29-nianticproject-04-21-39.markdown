Rumor has it P. A. Chapeau, aka +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")Â is roaming the Clusters in Pasadena, apparently with some high priority intel related to today's Anomaly.

From what I've heard he's also been talking about 'messages' from +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""). Not sure what that means yet. If you find him, let us know.

Check your scanner for clues that may lead you to him.
