PAC thinks a story about an astronomical event this month is  disinformation planted by Ken Owen to cover activity leading in to the Shōnin Anomaly...

Possible, but unlikely. It serves to illustrate, however, just how effectively someone like Ken Owen operates. What's real, what's a lie? The ability to engineer doubt is an incredibly powerful weapon.

If Owen and Phillip come to a head and one of them has to leave the NIA, I wonder who it will be, and where that person will go next...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Saw this and it reminded me of our old friend Ken Owen.  You might wonder where he got a job being a disinformation propagandist and news manipulator.  <br /><br />Apparently, he cut his teeth planting false stories and bogus science reports in journals and on the internet in order to mislead the public. Usually, he’d offer mundane explanations for covert operations.<br /><br />Now, despite the tension with Phillips, I hear he's managing to hang on to that role at the NIA. Who knows how long that'll last.<br /><br />I wonder if this is a cover story for certain things taking place in front of this anomaly.<br /><br /></div>
