Who stole the corpse of Jarvis?

This BOLO, sent to me today, appears to have originated from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

According to the document, the corpse, held there since it was extracted from the former Niantic Project facility in Geneva, has gone missing.

The details of how the body disappeared are not apparent. The motivation of the group behind the incident are also unknown.

**Why has this happened? Is the goal of the group behind this to support or prevent the rebirth of the Jarvis XM Entity? Who would have to resources to pull something like this off? Do you think it was a corporate or government interest, or as the BOLO describes, a group of Factional extremists?**Â 

Less than a week remains until Reckoning Day, and each day, the stakes seem to rise.

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
