I spent the night awake with worry. Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") is reaching its final moments, and sleep was not going to come easy. I decided to use the time exploring the Cassandra Signal that emerged from the Portals earlier this week, piecing it together and ordering it as accurately as I could. 

Dr. Lightman, the Theological Physicist and Glyph expert weighed in recently on the unknown Glyphs in the Signal. His findings are not comforting.

After the Enlightened once again rose to capture Cologne this morning, the skies are gray and filled with uncertainty. Despite the evidence that suggests the Enlightened may in fact be being used to forward an agenda I don't believe they agree with, they blindly barrel forward. My fellow Resistance in New York and Chicago face a monstrous challenge in the twilight of [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra ""), one that will require every ounce of their... our... resolve. I can only hope that we are prepared for what lies ahead.

What I know for a fact is, that when today is over, regardless of which faction claims [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra ""), the world will be tangibly different. If the Enlightened succeed, we may begin to see a shift at the highest levels of power as their vision and agenda begins to spread through the leadership structure. If the Shaper Self Destruct code is indeed a real thing, by the time this day is over, it may have begun to take grip. If the Resistance capture the day, I believe we will have staved off this crisis, but for how long? The burden of protecting our world from the unknown is ours to bear as long as we color ourselves Blue, and we are wading through a thick muck of the unknown.

**We stand right now at a crucial moment in our understanding of ourselves. What we represent, what we fight for, what we fight against. I find it's easy for the individual to get lost against the roar of an agenda. As we head into the closing of ****[#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "")****, who are you, the individual, and what are you in it for? I wonder, will your answer be different now and after we know how Operation ****[#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "")**** ends. If so, I'd like to hear what changed.**

A passcode as always to those who share meaningfully in our discussion today.
