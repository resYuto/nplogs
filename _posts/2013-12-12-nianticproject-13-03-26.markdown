What paths will emerge after [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") ends?

It's been a week filled with Journeys. Yesterday four massive links tore across the Pacific, linking Hawaii to California. A ruse. Four Shards journeyed earlier to Cupid's Span in San Francisco directly from Russia. Moments ago, a massive Resistance Link was created across the Atlantic, presumably a transport link for a Shard destined for Buenos Aires.

Lynton-Wolfe travelled to Buenos Aires to exploit a WWII project that may have been abandoned there, brought there on a submarine filled with gold and secrets.

Hank Johnson made this way to Phoenix, seeking a clue to guide him to his true destination: a [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") sanctum.

In the aftermath of the December 7th Anomalies, members of the victorious factions recovered pieces of a map charting Alexander the Great's travels through Asia. Known there as Sikander, the commander tore through regions that went on to become Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and more. Some say he was looking for something. 

I have obtained a copy of the map +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") sought. Marked on it, with a Glyph we've seen before, is the location that I think Hank intends to travel to.

**Days remain until the culmination of ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")****. What status quo will emerge... What journeys will come next?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
