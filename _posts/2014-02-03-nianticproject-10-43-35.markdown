+[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")Â has released a new track titled Duplicity.

The message he chose to accompany it speaks to those of use who have to struggle with the difficulty of inner conflict. This is something I empathize with deeply, and I'm sure I'm not alone.

As usual, Dalby has released individual instrument stems to encourage all other Agents and Investigators to use them as ingredients for expressing their own creativity.

**Hidden within the tracks, however, I discovered a deeper, darker secret. That secret is deserving of cold analysis as we prepare for what lies ahead.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
