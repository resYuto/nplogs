Bienvenue, +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 ""), we've heard so much about you, now we finally hear you.

After remaining an almost mythical figure since the beginning of this Investigation, Enoch has emerged into the digital world, and what's more, it appears he intends to emerge into the physical one as well at the Seattle  [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")  Anomaly.

Agents on the ground there will have a unique opportunity to hear him perform in person. I'm envious.

Music is an intensely personal thing, but I'm personally quite moved by the first piece he's chosen to share with us. Entitled 'elegy,' it's a composition dedicated to his soul-mate and cherished XM researcher +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 ""), who died tragically and under mysterious circumstances in the fallout of Operation  [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") . (Listen to it on  +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")'s page) 

An Investigator on his Soundcloud page wrote: *"Carrie is unsure about what she is doing or supposed to do, she tries to be brave and do it anyway. A flashback to something recent and happy but also dark and past. Carrie spends night upon night of research before she does her feat. It begins to all blur together. She fades asleep. She dreams about walking through a dark corridor, ribbons of information swirling around her. It's nice at first then gets chaotic. More and more chaos. Then pop, it all just fades like she is a rock sinking into the dark murky waters of the ocean. Thats what I got from the song."*

**Venture into the music, and share the story you see.**

Looking forward to more, Mr. Dalby.

A passcode to those who enrich our dialog with insight, ideas and memories.

Some things can only be expressed in words... As is well known, I was a member of the Niantic Project until recently. I mourn the death of +Carrie Campbell, who was many things to me. If my music was a key, she was the lock.  A sensitive in many ways, I mourn her in music.
Her spirit is the world's music, and I will share it here.
Enjoy, and I hope to see you on 10/26 at Sole Repair Shop in Seattle.
