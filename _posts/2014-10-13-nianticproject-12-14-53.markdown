A warning from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") to those who have been on his tail.

I doubt Hank would try to send a message like this to 13MAGNUS or AntiMagnus operatives, so I suspect that Calvin, once again, has decided to keep an eye on Hank's journey.

That didn't go so well last time. Remember the Congo?

Hopefully Calvin (if he was indeed the intended recipient) got the message...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Last night I noticed that I was being followed by both drone and operative. I shot the drone down myself, and the operative... got himself in an ugly situation and is no longer on my tail. <br /><br />I know you are reading this, and I repeat: <i>Do not follow me.</i> It’s hard enough keeping myself alive, much less the people tracking me.<br /><br />I bear no one any ill will, but I have to go on this mission alone. What I’m doing is for the benefit of all mankind. Too many people have already died trying to grab me.<br /><br />Stay away.<br /><br /></div>
