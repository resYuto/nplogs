+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares an update as he makes his way to Oakland for the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomaly.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Am taking a circuitous route to Oakland to shake some tails. I’m trying to meet up with Wright, but it’s difficult when two elusive beings try to synchronize.  Particularly interested in a comment he made on a post in Operation Essex, stating that he and a prominent investigator were thinking along the same lines: <a href="https://goo.gl/FYthKg" class="ot-anchor">https://goo.gl/FYthKg</a>.  <br /><br />The full magnitude of Calvin’s planning for the Niantic project is becoming clear to all of us. I am also developing a theory as to why Jarvis manifested at Cupid’s Span in the same period.  <br /><br />Ingress Agents should make a pilgrimage to the original Niantic Plaque and Cupid’s Span while they are in the Bay Area. The past defines the present, and these places are historic to anyone who is aware of the power of XM.<br /> <br />If something happens to me, I want you to ponder one question: Is it an accident that a pyramid was built over the grave of the Niantic?<br /><br /></div>
