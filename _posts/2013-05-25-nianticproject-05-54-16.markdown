Yesterday +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shared a message via his Google+ profile, he is trying to locate sites related to XM influenced civilizations like Cahokia that may have existed in North America (including Mexico). My gut feeling is that this may be connected to the Cross Plains anomaly. Click over to his page to add your contribution.

+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s novel, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).

A continued reminder that investigators planning to be in Cross Plains, TX to witness and study the anomaly taking place on June 7th and 8th should pre-register for Howard Days ASAP ( [http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854](http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854 "") ).
