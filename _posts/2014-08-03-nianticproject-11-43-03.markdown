This recent, classified dispatch from Strategic Explorations, a subsidiary of +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""), reveals that +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "")'s research is at a standstill until either the Portals returns to their normal, high-output state, or one of the XM Corporations provides him access to their XM reserves.

Unfortunately for Lynton-Wolfe, he has managed to burn the bridge with both +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") and +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""). That leaves +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), but it seems unlikely they would back him.

The brilliant but otherwise unstable researcher is known to bite the hand that feeds.
