Misty Hannah's first attempt to hyperthread across LA has failed. I wonder if she will try again.

I'm curious to hear from the agents who participated. Enlightened: What was your initial strategy? How did the situation evolve and how did you copy?

Resistance, how did you cope with the random jump to Node 04? What strategies enabled you to take the day?
