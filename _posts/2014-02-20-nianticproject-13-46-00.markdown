+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") surfaced yesterday in the aftermath of the discovery of Glyphs in the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner app.

I received this transcript today. I don't know if it preceded yesterday's discoveries, but it's interesting that after a long period of silence, Devra surfaces not once but twice. It could be nothing, or it could be that something's afoot. I don't know the answer to that question yet.

Devra and Calvin opened the floodgates, discussing a number of topics. I can see in their conversation some of the comfort and openness that must have been the cornerstone of their working relationship at Niantic. 

**There are a number of topics worth exploring here, and I welcome discussion on all of them, but there's one sentence in particular that I'm personally focusing on: "God knows what Jarvis is, but it's something not natural."  And simply for the sake of discussion, I pose the question... What if it is? What would that mean for us?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
