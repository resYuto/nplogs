Jarvis has divided into shards? Unclear what this could mean for all of us...

Agents are speculating that this could perhaps be the result of modified UltraStrike weapons Dr. Lynton-Wolfe 'borrowed' from +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") when he decided to badge out of the office one last time. I think that's unlikely.

We know Lynton-Wolfe has been attempting to rapidly experiment with Chaotic Matter, and the UltraStrike and most other XM technology that exists to date was developed without this resource.

No. I think this is something different entirely, but what? Of that, for now, I am at a loss.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>IQTech Research</h2>FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLIC RELEASE:<br /><br />Earlier today in Bangkok, Thailand, Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe made use of a new type of XM construct based on Chaotic matter.  <br /><br />Timed to take full advantage of the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS">#13MAGNUS</a>  Anomaly, his goal was apparently to destroy the Jarvis Entity.  <br /><br />Our analysis indicates that, despite a major disruption of the XM fabric, the Jarvis Entity was <b>not</b> destroyed.  Data is still coming in but it appears that parts of the construct or perhaps entire replicas of the construct have exploded outward to other Portal locations.  <br /><br />We do yet fully understand the mechanism or implication of this ‘sharding’ effect.<br /><br /></div>
