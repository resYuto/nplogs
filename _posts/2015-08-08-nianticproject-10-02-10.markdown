Is ADA truly dead, or merely a phoenix awaiting rebirth?

All of us are still trying to process exactly what happened yesterday on +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 "").

It appears that, as +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "") had predicted, an attack on +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") took place from within the NIA. It's likely that Henry Bowles and 855 were behind this attack.

ADA's guest appearance on Behind the Scanner, what was expected to be a short Q and A as many other special guests before her, turned instead into an unexpected, and at times disturbing distress call, as the AI slowly unraveled.

Some of you may have already seen this. I'd advise those of you who haven't to do so.

Hidden within here are clues that could lead us to what comes next.
