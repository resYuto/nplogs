This week on the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""):

Some great new Sitreps, including Operations Feast, Opus, Fire and Ice, Over-lord, Blue Skin/White Cap and many more.

+November Lima hits the road again.

New commands emerge in the Glyph Hack Command Channel.

And the Obsidian Finale on April 2nd approaches at breakneck pace, with +Susanna Moyer herself planning to be present in Hong Kong, while the Acolyte will be in Vienna and Jahan in Orlando.
