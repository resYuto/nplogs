Susanna Moyer continues her look back at the last year of the Niantic Investigation. This week, she focuses on the events of Interitus: Jarvis's warning against the rise of ADA, Klue and Machine Intelligences, and Helios: Bogdanovich's devastating Portal Virus and the revelation of the Helios Artifacts, which would go on to become beacons to the unknown force that lie at the heart of the Darsana Anomalies, the N'zeer.

In the coming weeks, Susanna will look back at the best sitreps and operations of the last two years. If you believe you know an operation that deserves to be highlighted, share it on Google+ and Facebook with the hashtag [#IngressYearTwo](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearTwo "").
