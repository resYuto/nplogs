Another recent transcript, this one between ADA and Henry Bowles, Lead Developer for Systems (one assumes, including the assembly of ADA from Omnivore components) at the Niantic Project.

ADA seems acutely aware that shutdown process that Director Yuen Ni began at the beginning of the month has a direct impact on her. She seems to have a plan in motion, but will it be enough?Â
