+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "")Â reports from the ground on the fiercely contested XM Anomaly that took place in New Orleans this weekend, with Satellites in Oklahoma City, Santo Domingo and Virginia Beach. In addition, Susanna brings the news on two massive Global XM Anomalies, which spanned the Shaper Septicycles 2014.42 and 2014.43.

An anonymous tip begins to slowly shed light on what the Darsana Point means, but +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), who is seeking to uncover the true nature of the force known as the N'zeer, has not been heard of since reports emerged of a massive firefight near his location in India.

In Novosibirsk, Agent AIexVK help commemorate the second year of Ingress with a massive cross-faction (literally) Field Art. In the UK, months of planning enable Agents to lift a flag and a poppy to honor those who died during World War I, and in Virginia Beach, Agents taking part in the Anomaly compete at a different level as well: Raising food for the needy, ending the day with a score of $6,412.

In Japan, a leaked document brings news of a massive network of previously undiscovered Portals at Lawson stores.

The next [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Anomalies will take place on December 13th in Tokyo, Barcelona and Charleston, with Satellites in Auckland, Manila, Seoul, Pretoria, Stuttgart, Toulouse, Hartford, Rio de Janeiro and Santa Cruz.

Over the next few weeks, Susanna will be looking back at the best Sitreps and Operations of the past two years. Be sure to share your favorites with [#IngressYearTwo](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearTwo "") on Facebook and Google+.
