Another truly remarkable set of observations emerged in the thread yesterday. It was an epic read, thanks all of you for contributing.

We talked about the three Corporations involved in XM development, +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""), +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") and +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), and what their factional alignments might be.

Today, I want to hear your thoughts on the individuals, Ex-NIA and otherwise. Where do you think they lie on the Faction spectrum? Some we are pretty clear on,  +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") for example is pretty clearly Enlightened. +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""), well, if you've been paying attention you know where her beliefs rest now. But what about Calvin, Ni, Devra and the rest? 

As usual, compelling and thoughtful opinions will earn a passcode from my private stash.
