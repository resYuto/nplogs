So, apparently a package that was supposed to be delivered to +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") at  [#timezero](https://plus.google.com/s/%23timezero "")  got left with the Enlightened agents on the ground there.

+[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") has offered a bid in exchange for one of the images from within the package. I wonder if +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") and +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") will up the ante.

My intel suggests there may have been multiple images in the package.

Will keep you updated.
