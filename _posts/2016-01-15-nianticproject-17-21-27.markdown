After [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon ""), Jahan extended +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") an interesting offer, but could she be trusted?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Sometimes you just have to walk away.<br /><br />After <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a>, Jahan offered a reconciliation between her esteemed family and the Azmati clan, which, through the strange shifts of fate I now head. Her idea was simple. We join forces and become a unity of Enlightened and Resistance in order to control the interference of transdimensional forces -- both the Shapers and the N’zeer.<br /><br />If things were different, I would see the wisdom of, and embrace this notion.  But things aren’t different. Jahan betrayed me once and I can not let it happen again. <br /><br />Not now. Not until I know more about the Circle of Obsidius.<br /><br />I am seeking a conversation with the Acolyte. She’s elusive, and I understand why. She’s hunting for the arrows of Obsidius and simultaneously being hunted by the forces of the N’zeer -- Jahan very likely among them.<br /><br /></div>
