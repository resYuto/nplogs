For the last few months, Calvin and Owen have been slowly building an ideological alliance. Now, they prepare to make their move.

While both these intelligence operators share the patriotic fervor of people like Jay Phillips, their vision of how their power and influence emerges is more nuanced. Against difficult odds, they are trying to bring the NIA into the information age.

While we know who's behind the hit order on +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "")'s contract has never been traced back. By reaching out to all the players in the circle of power, they are hoping that, somewhere, the right recipient will get the message and perhaps stand down.

What's invisible to us is the political complexity of this gambit. Institutions are slow to change, mindsets even slower, and power always seeks to preserve itself. Lorazon is placing all his chips on this side of the table, hoping that Calvin and Owen will fail and create opportunities for his own advancement.
