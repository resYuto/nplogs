Thanks to the tremendous efforts of +Johnathan Chung ([https://plus.google.com/114424163811716070551/posts](https://plus.google.com/114424163811716070551/posts "")), +Verum Inveniri ([https://plus.google.com/109846653838501599116/posts](https://plus.google.com/109846653838501599116/posts "")) and many individual agents, investigators and alliances the world over, we are finally in possession of the complete set of Tycho storyboards depicting Epiphany Night and Jarvis and Devra's daring escape from the Niantic Lab.

Many thanks to all those whose efforts made this possible....
