Niantic Scientists Under Interrogation
BREAKING

TransGlobal Press International Wire Service

GENEVA, Switzerland (TPI) – The remaining Niantic Scientists who were escorted out of the facility earlier today are currently believed to be under interrogation by HAZDATA staff. Geneva police first confirmed, then denied that a death had occurred.

An undisclosed source told this reporter that Kureze had been murdered. ‘Found in lab, very suspicious circumstances.’

Analysts are currently questioning whether the death of Victor Kureze is tied to an Ingress ‘Player’ event in which data packages were released from the facility and ‘harvested’ by operatives across Europe.

The true relationship between the Niantic Project and the 'Ingress Game' has been the subject of rumors and speculation previously. Thus far, little attention has been paid by the mass media.

A murder in Geneva may change all of that.
