I believe this connects to the item of evidence recovered yesterday.

Although strategically redacted, I'm certain that with some analysis and deduction, we can determine both voices in the transcript.

**Who is the other speaker, and once we've answered that question, how do we interpret the relationship between them? What does this 'transaction' mean for the future?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
