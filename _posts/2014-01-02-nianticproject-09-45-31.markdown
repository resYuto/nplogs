Who lay dead on the ground next to Jarvis at the Zurich Train Station?

A leaked document reveals that an investigation appears to be taking place, helmed by someone named J. Brandt. If memory serves, we've heard that name before. The exact nature of the investigation remains unclear to me, but judging from the document, we can begin to make some educated guesses.Â 

**What do we know about the woman slain that night? The basic answer is known, but it doesn't lead us anywhere. What kind of person was she? Why did ADA contact her and put her in that situation, and not someone else? What is your interpretation of this document and the nested transcript, and why do you think J. Brandt stands at the center of this new probe? What do we know about her, and where might this lead?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
