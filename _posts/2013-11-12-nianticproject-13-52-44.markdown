The story so far... (from +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s perspective, that is).

Perhaps as an attempt to redeem herself in the eyes of many after the CDC video leaks last week, Dr. Bogdanovich today released a history of her role in an era that history has yet to judge: The age of XM.

**She does a fairly good job of summarizing what's transpired in the Niantic Investigation so far, but of course, there are gaps. Some, perhaps as a result of the need for brevity, others possibly to keep her own sometimes questionable actions in the shadows. Read through her account. What has she failed to highlight overall, and where has she occluded her own complicity and responsibility in what's transpired?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation today.
