I was able to obtain copies of the wanted posters the NIA handed out at Cupid's Span last Thursday. We were there, but they missed us. It's a stark reminder that the powers that be still seek to silence conversation about Exotic Matter, portals and Ingress.

I've been told the wanted posters were loaded with asset redemption codes that will in the future be activated to redeem cutting edge XM technology. Bribery will only go so far, I know that the investigative community will protect us.

Felicia Hajra-Lee's novel The Niantic Project: Ingress is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).

A continued reminder that investigators planning to be in Cross Plains, TX to witness and study the anomaly taking place on June 7th and 8th should pre-register for Howard Days ASAP ( [http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854](http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854 "") ).
