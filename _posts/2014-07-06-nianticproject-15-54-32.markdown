+[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 ""), P. A. Chapeau or whatever it is you're calling yourself these days.

I know you've been watching the events of  [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")  unfold. I know you've heard about ADA, and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and what they are becoming, or perhaps have become already.

Now is not the time for for silence. We need to hear from you. We need to know where you stand.

It's time you spoke clearly about your role in all this. You owe all of us some answers.
