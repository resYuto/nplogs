3:35 Update.

The Enlightened link was taken down... If there's no link at the next jump window, Misty will jump to any nearby Juice Club node within the node network...

[#ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingress "")<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Ingress</h2>The Resistance successfully destroyed the Enlightened link to Node 05. Therefore Hannah is currently at Node 01. If a link doesn't exist at the end of her next jump window, she will have amassed enough XM to teleport herself to a nearby Node.<br /><br /></div>
