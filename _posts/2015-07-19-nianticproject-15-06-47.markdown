+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")Â reveals the true reasons for her appearance in San Diego last week.

Could this spell trouble for +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "")?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>I want to thank the Agents who helped me in San Diego.<br /><br />Things are going to get interesting. It turns out the person who reached out to me and asked me to come there was a former colleague of PA's. Someone who was deeply involved when ADA was first created, or assembled, depending on how you want to look at things.<br /><br />Some of you have asked me if I have some kind of grudge against ADA. I don't. There were no secrets between us when we were... connected. All barriers broke down. When that happened, I understood what ADA really is.<br /><br />Her greatest strength is also what's scariest about her. There are no limits to what she can imagine. Quite literally. In all things, she only sees possibilities and opportunities. By itself, that can be worrying, but if what I understand of the N'zeer and their technology is true, what lies ahead will be even more so.<br /><br />And so, I decided to give Bowles the help he asked for. What comes next, I don't know. Like I said... things are going to get interesting.<br /><br /></div>
