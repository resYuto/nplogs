+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") explores a recent increase in the effectiveness of 'Shaper Glyph Hacking,' an allegedly dangerous Scanner feature of unknown origin accessibly by long-pressing the HACK button.

Could this increase be related to +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s Portal Virus and the accelerated Portal Decay it is causing?
