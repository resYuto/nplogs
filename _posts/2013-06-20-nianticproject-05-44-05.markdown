Another video from the memory card that +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") arranged to be delivered to +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") . Given Visur's interest in the London Anomaly, and the increasing importance attached to the symbols that Hank is on the trail of, I wouldn't be surprised if the PMC operatives tracking Hank were Visur operatives. 

So, here's my read: If Visur is trying to track and intercept Hank, and Hank's on the trail of the symbols, my guess is that all three corporations are probably trying to get their hands on them. But why?

How does a series of glyphs in a mine that time forgot help a company like Visur, Hulong or IQTech win an XM arms race? The answer? Not sure, but I'm open to hear your ideas.
