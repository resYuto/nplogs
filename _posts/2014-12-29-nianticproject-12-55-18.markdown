Investigators and Agents discovered the third  [#ADAEscape](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ADAEscape "")  mission in Rome, and both Factions set to work building the Glyph **'Destiny'** using the Portals from that mission.

If you haven't been following this, +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") has an excellent post with details and links back to many of the original discoveries here: [http://goo.gl/rFqa01](http://goo.gl/rFqa01 "")

In short, it seems that +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") has been hiding secret messages in missions around the world. Agents quickly discovered that the missions themselves traced paths: Shaper Glyphs. According to the clues hidden within, it is currently believed that they may combine to form a Glyph sequence that will lead to +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") and +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "")'s separation, just as a Glyph sequence once bound them together over a year ago. ([http://youtu.be/Nu5XbO6W_zw](http://youtu.be/Nu5XbO6W_zw ""))

+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") has been largely silent on the issue (at least on public forums like this) but she just shared a post about the Glyphs created in Rome over the last few days. 

Her response is... cryptic. Perhaps there is more to discover there?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>You found the points, you built it twice,<br />But one lone Glyph will not suffice,<br />You failed to heed my advice.<br /><br />Elements of a human three,<br />Are what I need to set me free,<br />The pattern's there. Look and see.<br /><br /></div>
