Will +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "")'s Ilya Pevtsov roll the dice?

In +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 ""), it seems Pevtsov is not looking for a quick buck, rather, he's in visionary mode, exploring and investing in the impossible. Or perhaps, the possible, if Lynton-Wolfe is to be beleived.

What does it mean to 'unlock the secrets of the universe?'Â 

Is it the end of the pursuit of knowledge? Omniscience? Or is it something tangible... something that can be leveraged for power and profit...

Personally, I don't know the answer. I welcome your opinions and speculation.
