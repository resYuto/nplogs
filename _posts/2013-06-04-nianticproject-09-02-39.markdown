+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â shared a hand-drawn map via his Google+ page. It's an articulation of something he calls 'The Nomad Hypothesis,' a theory Hank has developed for discovering ancient sites using their 'XM shadows.'

+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s novel, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>My theory, known as the Nomad Hypothesis, is that Exotic Matter drifts outwards from portals over thousands of years. That ancient XM leaves a shadow that I know how to detect. In the path of these XM shadows, you can often find an ancient civilization, shrine or significant artwork.<br /><br />These trace patterns helps to explain why an ancient civilization can flourish in one place, but then decay and die. Portals disappear taking their inspiring power with them. Ancient civilizations are built on the portals of yesterday.<br /><br /></div>
