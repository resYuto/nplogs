Calvin is in the clear, or so it seems. It seemed unlikely to me that Calvin would support a violent action against his long-time collaborator +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), but the evidence was ambiguous. This transcript, if true, places the blame squarely on Lorazon.

My feeling is we are witnessing something greater than an assassination attempt. Lorazon's brazen insubordination could potentially be the beginning of an elaborate power-play. If the political chips land in his favor, he demonstrates leadership to the powers that be and may leverage that to unseat Calvin at the helm of +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "").
