A source sends +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")Â a mysterious clue.. but what (or where) is it? And what does it lead to?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>A source sent this my way. No explanation attached. At first I thought it was some kind of stylized AT-AT, but the more I looked at it, I realized it was something else... a lumbering beast of steel and concrete.<br /><br />Can anyone help me dig deeper?<br /><br /></div>
