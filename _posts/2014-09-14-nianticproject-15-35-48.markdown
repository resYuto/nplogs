Yesterday, Agents across Europe began to rescue a Top Secret classified briefing on the origin, development and, possibly, future of the Artificial Intelligence created at the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 ""), ADA.

Half of the pieces have been recovered so far, and thanks to the effort of the those who help maintain the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") Wiki, investigators like +[JoJo Stratton](https://plus.google.com/108824342371548161778 ""), the fragments obtained so far are documented here: [http://niantic.schlarp.com/investigation:documents:metis](http://niantic.schlarp.com/investigation:documents:metis "")

I am hopeful that all remaining fragments will be collected by Agents within the next 24 hours, so that this informative and detailed document can be examined in full.

In the interim, those interested in studying the pieces that have emerged so far should visit the TS//METIS page at the Wiki.
