This is the second page from the new Tycho comic that was delivered to me yesterday. It depicts one of the many moments in Dr. +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") and Roland Jarvis' escape from the Niantic Facility where ADA's timely actions kept them on the route she had obviously orchestrated to the finest detail.

ADA: At times I envy her. At times I pity her. Most recently, I have begun to question, if not fear her.

When +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") shared his most recent Glyph research, we were finally able to translate the Glyph sequence ADA transmitted to Klue in the direct aftermath of [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "").

The Translation is as follows:

_Open All, Clear All, End All. 
Open Mind, Open Soul, Open Body. 
Begin. _

**What is ADA up to? What has she done to ****+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")****, and can she be trusted any longer? Some investigators have suggested that this sequence seems innocuous. To others, it appears to have devastating consequences. I remain unsure, but highly concerned nonetheless.**

A passcode, as always, to those who meaningfully contribute to our discussion.
