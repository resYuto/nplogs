+[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "") claims that speculation about the arrival of the N'zeer has greatly increased his 'market-value.'

What do you think... Would he jump ship from +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") so quickly? He *is* a notoriously fickle individual, but he doesn't have many potential homes left....

Maybe this is leverage to force a 'renegotiation' with Ilya Pevtsov?
