We know the ancient XM Artifacts are connected somehow to the life (and death?) of Alexander of Macedon. We know that [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") may protect ancient secrets, among them the power of resurrection, or perhaps of 'simulacrization,' if such a thing exists.

I'm going to ask you to venture into history, do some research and ask a few very important questions that will shed light on the power these Ancient Artifacts may hold, Alexander's life and death, the power of [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") and the roles +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") and ADA may play in all of this.

**How did Alexander die? What became of his body? Where is it now? Where is his tomb?**

**As you search for these answers, share your findings. In them, we will find one of the most elaborate and brazen cover-ups in written history.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
