*"I suspect I saw Antoine Smith during the firefight outside the cave. I looked him right in the eye for an instance as I was running away from the Anomaly Zone. He could have killed me, but he didn’t. Or perhaps, he couldn’t."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I have not responded to the message from ADA. I need to know more. <br /><br />I am reading of Devra’s adventures in The Niantic Project: Ingress (<a href="http://goo.gl/3x3Uzp" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/3x3Uzp</a>). Is it really possible that Felicia Hajra-Lee wrote that book before the real events took place? And Devra... I didn’t know she had it in her to deal with mysterious assassins and covert operations.<br /><br />More personally amusing to me, the Thomas Greanias book: Alignment: Ingress (<a href="http://goo.gl/TyBmMc" class="ot-anchor">http://goo.gl/TyBmMc</a>) which is a fictionalized account of real events that I participated in during my previous recursion. I have no idea where the blurry line lies in there... At times I am fairly certain I could never be the person in that book. Other times, it seems just like me. It's frustrating re-learning my own past in this way.<br /><br />By the way, based on the description in that book I suspect I saw Antoine Smith during the firefight outside the cave. I looked him right in the eye for an instance as I was running away from the Anomaly Zone. He could have killed me, but he didn’t. Or perhaps, he couldn’t.<br /><br /></div>
