An email between +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") and Carrie Campbell sheds new light on the Cross Plains anomaly, but they're speaking in code. Let me know if you can figure out what they are talking about.  

+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s novel, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is available on Google Play ( [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKE4MsCPlX8C "") ) and in the Amazon e-book store ( [http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q](http://www.amazon.com/The-Niantic-Project-Ingress-ebook/dp/B00CTSZQ9Q "") ).

A continued reminder that investigators planning to be in Cross Plains, TX to witness and study the anomaly taking place on June 7th and 8th should pre-register for Howard Days ASAP ( [http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854](http://www.rehupa.com/?p=3854 "") ).
