Finally, a word from an old friend. 

She was online for only a brief instant before she severed her communication channel, probably to continue to fly under the radar and avoid Omnivore.

My guess is, given this new information, that a new status quo may already have come into play with regards to Niantic's shuttered Geneva facility, although I do not yet have any evidence to confirm this.

For today's question, I want to discuss the personnel who remained at Niantic after the shutdown, and how they might be leveraged under the new status quo. As usual, a passcode for those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion today.

What do we know about them? What are their skillsets and value?
