UPDATE TO SITUATION IN GENEVA:

BREAKING
TransGlobal Press International Wire Service

GENEVA, Switzerland (TPI) – An estimated dozen Niantic Security officials have been ‘taken into custody’ by HAZDATA Operatives. After a brief standoff lasting about 30 minutes Niantic Project Security Officials relinquished their weapons and surrendered to HAZDATA control forces.

There was no apparent involvement of Swiss police or military forces. There are no reports of shots being fired or admissions to local medical facilities. A man wearing a Hazdata uniform claimed that this was a ‘training exercise.’ An observer on the scene said that it was ‘very well acted if it was a training scene.’

As of this reporting, HAZDATA Officials appear to be entering the facility. “It is hard to read what is going on’ the observer said. “There are no weapons drawn, but the atmosphere is ‘intense’, ‘professional’.
