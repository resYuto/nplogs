*"I suspect that it is no accident that the N’zeer have emerged.  It is as if we have opened up beacons of possibility, of evolution, of futures."*

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I’m coming very, very close to the truth.  <br /><br />What I am seeing is, well, Enlightening.  It is as if each new artifact opens a door to wondrous possibilities.  Wondrous futures.  Amazing possibilities.  I see now possibilities within possibilities.  We are so close.  <br /><br />I suspect that it is no accident that the N’zeer have emerged.  It is as if we have opened up beacons of possibility, of evolution, of futures.<br /><br />Yes, some will say that part of this is due to my my relationship with Jahan, but I see it as part of a piece. The more close one gets to the incandescence, the more likely they are to meet their counterpart, that thing that guides them.  In fact, she is so perfect that I, myself, wonder if she is but an illusion.  But I assure you, she is very real. And it bothers her not that I am a simulacrum...  In fact, perhaps this is a necessary step to the true light.<br /><br /></div>
