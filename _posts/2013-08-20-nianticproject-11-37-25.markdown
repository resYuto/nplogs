Always a bit odd when a surveillance transcript of myself comes flying back to me... Not the first time it's happened. It brings a slight smile to my lips, albeit a grim one.

It's true. +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") and I spoke recently. She's concerned, as I am, as every warm blooded member of the Resistance is: If the Enlightened capture Operation  [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "") , and the centers of power begin to be 'Shaped' it's the beginning of a new epoch for mankind. I'm not sure exactly what that means in concrete terms... the time now is better spent planning, recruiting and building our cause then fretting about the world-state in 6 days.

If we fail, we'll have time to fret about that for generations to come.

As you can see from the transcript, Carrie's grip on reality is... slipping. Like a human divining rod, she's sinking as deep into the abyss as she can. I only hope that when she comes up for air she's found something that's worth the risk she's taking, and that she comes up for air.

Susanna Moyer is on the move, and continues to document the day-by-day fallout of Operation Cassandra in her daily Burst Reports.

It seems the Glyphs and Carrie are back at the center of our discussion today. We've seen the Glyphs emerge from Portals, we've seen them built on the earth by Agents, some of whom submitted reports of experiencing 'strange' things while doing so. We've seen them slipstreamed into Susanna Moyer's  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "")  and appear in the artwork of visionaries.

*Dealing with the intelligence world taught me to think of unknowns in terms of Threats and Opportunities. What do you think the Threats and Opportunities are in the Shaper Glyphs? Is it possible Carrie will be able to find a way to use them to 'slam the door?' Or is she playing with a loaded weapon in the blind hope that there is no spoon... As always, a passcode for all those who share thoughtfully in our discussion today. *
