As many of you know from last week's [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""), +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") has devoted some of his very limited time left to working on a NOMAD special on XM Anomalies.

What's abundantly clear after this weekend's showdown in Santa Fe, and from many prior Anomalies that have had far-reaching repercussions, is that Anomalies are powerful, often world-changing events. It makes sense that Hank Johnson would want to document their power, perhaps his next simulacrum would not see the potential  in them that he does.

It could be that Human interaction with the Portals during past XM Anomalies have been the markers on our historical path to today.

If so, perhaps this is a message to all of us: On our path into the future, each fork in the road is marked with an XM Anomaly: A chance for influence to sweep over us, or be swept away.
