+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports on the largest Ingress Anomalies yet, which took place on August 9th in Taipei and Chicago with Satellites in Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Galveston and Richmond. Over 3000 Agents took part on the ground, but many more represented their causes: Matahari, Siren's Song, Choro Verde do Oeste and the Indian Enlightened's quest for Coimbatore were among many operations to take place across the world as Agents struggled to fight back against Bogdanovich's Portal Virus and take control of the Helios Anomalies. 

Agent MyGz reports from Kuala Lumpur for +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") and +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 "") reaches out to Agents who were at the Anomalies for their version of the day's events.

Meanwhile, the first [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts emerge into the Portal Network... what power do they hold? Does Surveillance footage of +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") hold the clues?

In Tech News, new versions of the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner and Intel Map bring new functionality to Agents on both iOS and Android.

And finally, congratulations to Agents @Philistine11 and @nsuneb.**Together Strong Future. Begin Journey.**
