New York Times Bestselling Author +[Thomas Greanias](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902 "")  has been in touch with me, and kindly offered to share the first chapter of his upcoming Alignment - Ingress with the investigative community.

Mr. Greanias says he has obtained a very sizable inventory of Ingress Scanner activation codes and Asset Redemption codes, and plans to share them online on Google+ on April 2nd, the day his novella goes on sale.
