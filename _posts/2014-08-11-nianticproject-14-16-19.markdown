+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") has transcribed the message recovered in Chicago yesterday.

It's possible the message was left by +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") prior to her death and survived to this day. Of course, there are other possibilities to consider.

Either way, the contents of the message are fascinating, and worthy of our Investigative efforts and speculation.
