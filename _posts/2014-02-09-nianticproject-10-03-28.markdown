Yesterday we discussed how the nature of influence and the character of the major centers of power in the world of +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") has evolved.

The NIA, attempting to free itself of its simplistic and brutal methods of secrecy, +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") probing deeper into the more dangerous aspects of XM research with no regard to the consequences, +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") retreating into the safety of a nationalistic agenda and reaffirming a position loyal to the NIA and the US Government. +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), of them all, has the least obvious pattern.

We've seen this transcript before, prior to translation by NIA operatives, although our Investigative community clearly excelled in extracting much of the nuanced subject matter in its own translation efforts. 

Ilya Pevtsov, and by extension Visur, seek nothing else than an overhaul of the structure of human life.

Clarke's Third Law ("Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic") comes up often in our conversations, but his Second Law is equally appropriate at times like this: "The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible."

**If one could access the XM Patterns of any individual (at any time) as ****+[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "")****'s speculation suggests, what would you do with such power? What technologies do you think will emerge as access and expertise within this realm spreads? How will these new technological opportunities shape and morph the human experience? And finally, as a Resistance or Enlightened Agent, do you see value in such a path for our species?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
