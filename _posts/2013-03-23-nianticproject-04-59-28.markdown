This image came my way. I was told it was some kind of coded map related to Hank Johnson's foray in the Congo.

I've tried laying it over the region in every possible way, and if it is a map, it's not one in the geographical sense, more of a series of metaphors using spatial relationships. Even then, it seems there's some kind of encoding mechanism keeping it obscure.

I've stared at it for most of the day with no new ideas.Â 

Have at it, and let me know what you can come up with.
