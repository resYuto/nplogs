Yesterday, a series of unattributable and unexplained glitches appeared in the Ingress Report. Thanks to a leaked SIGINT report from Omnivore today, we now know what those glyphs mean.

In addition, a Google+ profile for +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), former Niantic Researcher and self-described 'Quantum Theologian,' sprang to life earlier today, promising definitive scholarly interpretations of Shaper Glyphs. If you'll recall, the Resistance in Minneapolis allegedy obtained an early draft of one his research works, entitled 'The Lightman Decipherments,' after capturing Operation [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "").

Today I'd like to discuss the document itself. I read the translation offered up by Omnivore's Pattern Recognition systems and had a strong, gut-based reaction to it, but then after thinking for a moment, it occurred to me there might be multiple ways to read it. As always, a passcode for participating meaningfully.

What are your thoughts on the leaked Omnivore doc from today? How can we interpret this message, and is there any supporting evidence that we should take into account as we do so?
