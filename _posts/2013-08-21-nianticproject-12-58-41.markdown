A fascinating document came my way today, +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")'s Psychological Profile of [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") correspondent (if, given this document, that's even the right word...) Susanna Moyer. 

It was a welcome addition to my inbox. After this morning's crushing, humiliating setback in Paris, I needed something else to put my mind on.

The document makes some interesting suppositions and comes to some fairly well reasoned conclusions, but having lurked in the intelligence circuit long enough, I know that profiling is not rocket science, it's part divining rod and part pattern recognition. I would hesitate to take anything in this document as more accurate than a well-reasoned guess from a professional guesser.

The Paris Anomaly left a bitter taste in my mouth, but Resistance is hope, and I am hopeful that my fellow Resistance members will steel their resolves and take a sledgehammer to the situation. The incredible advances made by the DC and Boston Resistance have been pushed back, and time is running out, but still, I have hope.

Susanna Moyer reported once again from outside Chicago, continuing her day-by-day analysis of Operation Cassandra in the form of daily Burst Reports.

**Given the information presented in this document and our own analysis of her reporting since the inception of the Ingress Report, who exactly do you think Susanna Moyer is? Her background is exceptionally (I might say suspiciously) murky, and all attempts at learning more about her have led to dead ends. A message injection in a recent Ingress Report told us to dig deeper. But what might we find? A passcode, as always, for all those who share meaningfully in our discussion.**
