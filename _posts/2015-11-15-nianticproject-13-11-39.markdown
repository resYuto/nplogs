An Agent in New Orleans reported having a conversation with +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") earlier today.

Hank intimated that he was on a road to [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon ""), and that an important mission lay before him. The clues he was following seemed to be be connected to Coronado (or was it de Soto?). It was possible, he said, that the exploration of the New World may have been driven by the pursuit for Prime XM Objects.

No further details are known at this time...
