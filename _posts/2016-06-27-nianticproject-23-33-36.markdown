<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Much of last week centered around Jahan’s goals for the second set of Aegis Nova Anomalies on June 25th, but in the end, those plans were dust. The Enlightened claimed the June 25th Anomalies by a large margin, and now Jahan’s only hope is to prevent the Enlightened from using the Tokyo XM Anomaly to launch their attack against the AI. With no weapon to use against Jarvis, the most she can hope for is to succeed on defensive grounds.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
