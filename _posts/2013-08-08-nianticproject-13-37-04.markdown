My statement yesterday was met with dismay from some, hope from others, but with passion from all. That's good. Passion is going to help us drive through the challenges ahead.

I am many things. Too proud to admit when I'm wrong is not one of them, but for now, I strongly believe that the ground I'm standing on is firm. Jay Phillips, on the other hand...

Phillips and I have a bit of a history, and I've never really seen any redeeming qualities in the man. He too, is passionate, but he's also brutal, stubborn and since he was tasked to clean up the Niantic mess by then NIA Director Yuen Ni, he's been on a warpath.

The transcript I received today (the identity of the other party is unknown, but I have some suspicions) paints a... well... I'll let you draw your own conclusions.

**My thoughts have been circling around Jarvis recently. The Enlightened hold this man (or, I guess former man) in esteemed light, but I've never really seen a compelling case to ascribe him any trust. What do you think happened to him after Phillips executed him in Zurich? What exactly is the entity known as Jarvis these days? What information has he provided us to convince people to join his cause? Is it all hyperbole? Are the Enlightened simply grasping at straws? A passcode, as always, for participating thoughtfully in our conversation.**
