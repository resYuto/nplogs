The activation of the  [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "")  Artifacts brings with it good news: A return to normal for the Portal Network after the damage and weakening caused by the +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") Virus, but that's not all.

Individuals like +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") have issued stark warnings about the danger these Artifacts may pose, going so far as to suggest that we as a species may not be ready to take on the knowledge and power that they may unleash.

It seems Calvin is taking these warnings seriously. 

With the return of the Portal Network to normal levels, the NIA's 'Consortium' appears to be beginning to dissolve. I expected no less. Having weathered the worst of the storm, the corporate heads were likely eager to return to their individual camps and resume their machinations.
