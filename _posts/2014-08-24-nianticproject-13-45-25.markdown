The former Niantic Reseachers, +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") and +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), begin their work as consultants to the NIA's 'Consortium' of XM companies.

The first item on the agenda, a field analysis of the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts that are currently contained within a Portal in Boise, Idaho.

This letter, though heavily redacted, is quite revealing. 

It seems the scientists do not beleive they have the necessary knowledge to cause the activation of the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts. They are expecting that this will occur of its own accord. They do, however, intend to study the Artifacts as they begin to interact with the Portal Network.

Hidden within that observation, I expect they seek to unlock what is beleived to be the great power that these Artifacts contain.
