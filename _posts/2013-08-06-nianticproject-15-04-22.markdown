Today's leak deserves more thought and more commentary than I am prepared to provide in the window available to us today. If it is real, and I believe it is, it's a game changer.

We've been hearing some chatter about something called 'Cassandra,' and that name appears in today's document as well. Veiled, but it's there. I think it was a coded signal. The mega-Anomaly that Jarvis mentions: We are only beginning to understand what's at stake... 

Operation  [#Minotaur](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Minotaur "") , well... it seems that was just a precursor for what comes next.

Resistance Agents... Protect the intel you got after the Anomaly. Especially after today's drops, I'm concerned for your safety. What you hold may be the key in helping us get through what lies before us.

Today, we need to talk about Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe.He has always been a bit eccentric, and undoubtedly a genius. Almost every bit of tech you hold in your hands when you are out in the field is his brainchild, from the first Resonators and XMPs, to the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner device itself, but the high state of XM saturation he keeps himself in might be taking a toll. A passcode, as always, for participating meaningfully in our conversation. 

**Here is my question today: Why would Jarvis be reaching out to Lynton-Wolfe? People keep talking about Lynton-Wolfe's 'condition,' but what's going on with him exactly? Is it possible that he has been manipulating us already from his new position at ****+[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")****?**
