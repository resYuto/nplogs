"The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."

+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â shares an interesting article about the nature of time and causality.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>When P. A. Chapeau first created his Investigator Board, he had an Einstein quote up there:<br /><br />"The distinction between the past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."<br /><br />I enjoy, sometimes, going back to that statement and trying to untangle what it really means.<br /><br />This article I came across earlier goes a step further in pondering the nature of time, and of causality.<br /><br />As somebody interested in both the cutting edge of science as well as the past and how information travels through time, it's a fascinating read.<br /><br /></div>
