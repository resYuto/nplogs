I sensed this document's importance when it first surfaced following the XM Anomaly in Austin, TX.

This is a complete transcription of the scroll recovered by Hank Johnson and +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Agents from the XM Vaults there. 

Thank you, +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), for your assistance in verifying this translation.

To me, the interpretation and power of this series of Glyphs is quite clear, but I'll leave you to express your own opinions without priming you with my own.

A passcode to those who enrich this conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
