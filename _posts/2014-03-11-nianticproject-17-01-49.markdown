Resistance Agents in Austin and across the Artifact's transit path must be exhausted, relieved and proud.Â 

The second Recursion Artifact, Future, has been captured.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>Excellent work, Resistance Agents.<br /><br />Another XM Artifact is ours - a bright Future lies ahead.<br /><br />Thank you, and good luck as you continue this critically important mission.<br /><br /></div>
