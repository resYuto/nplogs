I have been able to gain access to the entire lost page from +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "")'s 'Voynich' journals. +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")Â was able to recover this during her investigation in Hamburg.

Unlike the other pages, this one does not seem to focus on a single Glyph. In addition, there seems to be a variety of colliding ideas. Some kind of map? A symbol of some kind? And what are the scrawled patterns on the right?

Some analysts have suggested that Carrie's explorations in this vision could have been what led her to Chicago during Operation Cassandra.
