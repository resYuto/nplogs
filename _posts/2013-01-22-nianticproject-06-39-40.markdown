This leaked transcript between Zeke Calvin, Yuen Ni and Oliver Lynton-Wolfe contains a nugget of truth. The real winner in any war is the arms-maker.

In addition to the transcript, an interesting piece of chatter from an Enlightenment group came my way today.. What interested me most was the report that Jarvis spoke to an operative from a portal, and specifically mentioned the Viator. If you've been paying attention, you know who that is. But what does it mean to 'control the Viator?'

"I was at Cahokia Mounds... there's a portal there and it 'said' something weird... 'They who control this portal when the sun goes down on Sunday control the Viator... It sounded like Jarvis's voice. I don't know whether this is real or not, but let's find out. Enlightenment, take and hold this portal on Sunday!"
