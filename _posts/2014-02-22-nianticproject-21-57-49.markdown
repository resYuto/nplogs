Possibly one of the closest Anomalies I've witnessed...

The Resistance maintain their victorious streak, capturing  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  02, and have gained critical intel leading to the second  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  Artifact.

Congratulations to both Factions, a truly spectacular burst of activity from both sides made this one for the history books.

Although the Anomaly was centered across 3 Sites, Agents throughout AS11-FOXTROT-07 and the world helped determine the Anomaly outcome.

By a razor thin margin, the Resistance capture #Recursion 02.
