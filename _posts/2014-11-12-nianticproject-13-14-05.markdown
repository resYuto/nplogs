+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") shares her disappointment at the leak of a letter requesting her resignation from her university, and presumably from academic life.

From her point of view, she is the true torchbearer for the movement that calls itself the Resistance.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Devra Bogdanovich</h2>I must say that I have been surprised by some events lately. The posting of my termination letter from the University seems quite unprofessional. And, quite honestly, I did not expect the vitriol of the response to Susanna’s interview with me.<br /><br />Am I not following the original Resistance path?  The path of caution?  The path of safety?  Yes. I did some things that at one time I was stringently opposed to, but where is the outrage for all of the others who are wantonly exposing the world to XM, and, I fear, Dark XM for profit and perhaps other, more sinister reasons? Are not those members of the Resistance who actually desire to unleash the N’zeer even more culpable than I... I could argue that they are more culpable than even the Enlightened...  The Enlightened are gullible, the Resistance risk turning Earth into a transdimensional battlefield.<br /><br /></div>
