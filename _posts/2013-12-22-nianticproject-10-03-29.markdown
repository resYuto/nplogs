What is +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") hiding?

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") emerged today with the translation of a new Shaper Glyph: *Harm*. It appeared above Hank's left shoulder in the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") edition of NOMAD. I expect the XM fields around the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") sanctum caused the Glyph to manifest, and given the way the transmission ended, perhaps for good reason.

This would all make more sense Hank Johnson hadn't appeared in Berlin earlier today, unscathed, unfazed and refusing to impart any details about the 'incident' whatsoever.

**Does anyone have a witness report from Berlin? What happened to Hank Johnson, and why is he refusing to share any of the details behind what transpired at the ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** sanctum?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
