Many strongly voiced opinions in yesterday's comment thread. I appreciate all those voices who believe that I will continue to share the intelligence I receive openly and free from bias, and hope that I can prove those of you that disbelieve wrong in time.

The intel received today is a leaked +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")  document, tracking intel received from +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") and +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") in their pursuit of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), probably during the Cross Plains Anomaly.

My question for the day, (a passcode to all who help build a meaningful discussion:

Who are the most likely suspects in the death of Dr. Victor Kureze?
