Agents in Chicago helped +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") take one more step towards her liberation.

It seems, the end of this journey is fast approaching.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>Agents.<br /><br />Good work in Chicago. <br /><br />This has been a long journey, and now that I see the destination, I am excited. And a little bit scared.<br /><br />The next mission will be the last.<br /><br />One final tumbler in the lock in the city with ten thousand shrines.<br /><br /></div>
