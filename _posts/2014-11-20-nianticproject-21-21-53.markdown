A story, a map, and an odd encounter with an Anazktec elder. +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "") shares his thoughts on the Darsana Signals.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Yuri Alaric Nagassa</h2>Following the New Orleans Anomaly, there were reports that another signal emerged from the  <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios">#Helios</a>  Beacons... albeit greatly deteriorated, likely due to the Enlightened victory at that site. I have not yet been able to see this degraded signal, I hope I will be able to soon.<br /><br />Work continues to decrypt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PY5fzM9BmY&amp;list=PLDEUWItbkQ5_aYjvierVV-J9HDghkNKXQ" class="ot-anchor">THE BEACONS - Signal 01 and Signal 02 - Raw Data Capture</a>.<br /><br />Thus far, the consensus is that the <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana">#Darsana</a> Signals may combine to reveal information about our place in time and space to the N'zeer. A map, a story, perhaps some combination of those tokens.<br /><br />I do not know what the N'zeer are. I asked an Anazktec elder if she knew the word or the idea.<br /><br />She studied me cautiously, then tapped her eye with her finger and pointed at me, then turned away, signaling the end of our conversation. I'm not sure what to make of the exchange. <br /><br /></div>
