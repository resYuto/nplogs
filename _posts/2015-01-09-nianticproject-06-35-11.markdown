Welcome to 2015. Agents around the world rang in the new year with inspired collaborative works of Field Art, including an ornamented Christmas tree in Moscow, a shooting star in Italy, a wrapped gift in New York and a massive, animated clock counting up to midnight in Yekaterinburg.

Scores of Agents also took part in the Ingress First Saturday on January 3rd, welcoming new recruits into their ranks and helping them start their new journey on the front foot.

News from another part of the world, however, was less warm. Recent events have revealed that Jahan, the biotech researcher who had taken +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")Â under her wing, is an agent of the cult known as AntiMagnus, and attempting to use both Hank Johnson and Azmati in an attempt to summon the N'zeer at the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") nest in Afghanistan.

And finally, +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s award winning book, The Niantic Project: Ingress, is now available as an audio-book, narrated by +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 ""), on Audible, Amazon and iTunes.
