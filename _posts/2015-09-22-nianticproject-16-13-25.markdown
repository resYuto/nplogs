+[Paul School](https://plus.google.com/109763890472937053947 ""), one of +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s former colleagues, shares a bizarre --- what was it? A dream? A hallucination? A prophecy?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Paul School</h2>I think this really happened...<br /><br />I was in Big Sur over the weekend, deep in the woods. It was about 1:00pm. Devra walked up to me. She looked radiant. I tried to talk to her, but she wouldn't, or perhaps couldn't, express herself. She seemed discombobulated, confused. She spoke of the lost. The scattered.<br /><br />She took my hand and led me to a clearing. I was surrounded there by beams of light. Dozens, at least. She looked at them, and I think I could read her lips as she mouthed the words 'my friends.' I looked back at the clearing, and I felt as though many more of 'her friends' had appeared. I wasn't wrong. More appeared, and then more still. A hundred, it seemed, there were so many.<br /><br />Then, four doors opened all around us. No, there more than that, twice as many. Her 'friends' began to run toward the doors.<br /><br />Devra looked at me. She seemed grateful.<br /><br />Then, it was all gone. The clearing. Devra. Everything.<br /><br />I was alone in Big Sur. I checked my watch. It was 1:15. Only fifteen minutes had passed, a single moment, but it had felt like hours.<br /><br />What is happening to me? Am I losing my mind?<br /><br /></div>
