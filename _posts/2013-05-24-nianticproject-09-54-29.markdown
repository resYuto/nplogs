Hank Johnson is seeking knowledge from those who share an interest in ancient civilizations.

I wonder if this is connected to the upcoming anomaly in Cross Plains, Texas.

-PAC<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Hello Nomad and Investigative Community:<br /><br />I need your help identifying the sites of ancient civilizations in North America (including Mexico).<br /><br />As you may have heard, Nomad has hit a bit of a rough patch, but I won't be stopped. The work continues...<br /><br />Looking forward to tapping your collective knowledge.<br /><br />HJ<br /><br /></div>
