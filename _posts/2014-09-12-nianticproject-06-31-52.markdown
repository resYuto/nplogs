+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports on the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomalies that took place in Minneapolis and Bogota on Saturday, September 6th. With over 2000 Agents on the ground, the Resistance made a bold comeback, seizing control of the Anomaly series from the Enlightened.

Across the world, the Final 15 Artifacts have manifested, and Helios races towards its finale, with London, Munich and Tacoma remaining. 

In the Netherlands, Enlightened Agents worked tirelessly to foil Resistance plans with Artifact #22, and in the Azores, Resistance Agents made a valiant effort to move Artifact #15 to the European mainland. Susanna also covers Operation Leprechaun from the Ireland, Operation CelebrEIGHT from Canada and Operation Cross Faction Star from the United States. Share your Sitreps at [http://www.ingress.com/report](http://www.ingress.com/report ""), and be sure to include pictures and video to highlight your achievements.

Finally, a new video has emerged revealing that ADA has grown increasingly bold, or perhaps desperate, in her pursuit of the [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Artifacts. 

Stay safe out there, Agents.
