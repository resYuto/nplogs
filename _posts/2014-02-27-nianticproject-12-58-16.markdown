Anyone remember Andy Nominus?

Early in the Niantic Investigation, a short section of a screenplay emerged penned by someone with that name (likely a pseudonym). The screenplay, in details that were later verified by other sources, told the story of Epiphany Night and Jarvis and +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s escape from the Niantic Facility.Â 

A sensitive with the gift of prescience, like Tycho, Nominus was channeling visions of a the future years before these events actually took place. The script was shopped around Hollywood for a while before ultimately being shelved. Some of the pages were recovered early in the Investigation and shared by PAC at that time. Storyboards, drawn by Tycho (small world...) also surfaced. They too only covered the pages discovered initially. It was believed that the rest of the screenplay was lost.

Turns out, that wasn't the case. An anonymous source reached out to me, claiming to have a copy of many more of the pages, perhaps the entire screenplay itself.

Here is his first shipment. It sheds light on +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "")'s past... a moment we'd heard about but never seen in detail. Lucky Louie makes an appearance. As does J. A. Potts. They've both been under out lens recently.

If the screenplay author's other visions are as accurate as his depiction of Epiphany Night, we're about to learn a whole lot more about some of the incidents that shaped the future Niantic Researchers...

**Does this new scene help shed any light on Misty's past? What other moments and people do you think we're likely to discover more of as further pages come to light?**
