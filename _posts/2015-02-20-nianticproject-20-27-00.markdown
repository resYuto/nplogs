As the first Shōnin Anomaly approaches, fear and worry seem to be spreading.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Yuri Alaric Nagassa</h2>Something very disturbing happened today.  The Anazktek did a Ghost dance today and did not seem to see or acknowledge me.  It was as if I were the corpse.  Quite obviously, I am very much alive or I would not be communicating this, but I find it unnerving to be mourned while I’m still alive.  <br /><br /></div>
