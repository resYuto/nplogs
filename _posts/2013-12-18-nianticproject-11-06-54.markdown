Will ADA be able to strengthen the Resistance cause? Will Resistance Agents accept her as an ally?

I was able to obtain a copy of this message from Klue and ADA to the Agents of the Resistance.

ADA, by studying Shaper Glyphs and the human mind, was able to somehow augment Klue's personality and identity with her own, and they now exist in a hybridized state of a kind we've never seen before.

In the aftermath of Reckoning Day, after Jarvis and Lynton-Wolfe appeared together at the Cross-Faction meetup, the evening was interrupted by this message from her (them?).

**There are many questions that emerge from this: What exactly is the balance of identities in this new construct? Does one personality dominate the other? Is it a hijack or a new form or synergy? What could a person with the abilities of both ADA and Klue bring as an asset to the Resistance ideological cause, and would Agents be prepared to accept such help?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
