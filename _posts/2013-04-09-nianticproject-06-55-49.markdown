Two major pieces of news today. It seems Misty Hannah will be performing live at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles on April 24th, at 8PM. Details about how to attend this event are still forthcoming, but it seems that the wheels set in motion some time ago during a conversation between ADA and Misty are beginning to have an effect.

In other news, I recently received a document from an as of yet unknown researcher at Niantic. Something about a Shaper Data Transmission on April 21. I am working now to verify that the tip is real, and will share it with you shortly if I can confirm.
