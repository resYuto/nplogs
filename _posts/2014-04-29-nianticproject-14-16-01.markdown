This series of video revealing +[November Lima](https://plus.google.com/108660770529072226626 ""), unfiltered and in its grittiest, was sent to me recently.Â 

After the vehicle and its driver went rogue, disregarding NIA orders and using new-generation on-board tech to avoid tracking by drone or satellite, a power struggle began. Both the NIA and Niantic Labs asserted jurisdiction over the vehicle.

The cost of that struggle can be weighed in lives. The evidence is now before you.
