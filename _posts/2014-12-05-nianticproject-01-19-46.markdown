Over the past two years, Agents have engaged in Operations that have showcased creativity and dedication at a truly memorable level. In her continuing series of specials marking [#IngressYearTwo](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearTwo ""), +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") looks back at some of the amazing things Ingress Agents have achieved and shared with each other. 

This week, the Report looks back at the evolution of Field Art, Agents who have undertaken journeys across countries and continents for their Factions, the increasing complexity of Agent-created events and the transformative, perhaps even 'shaping' power of the Ingress experience.

Next week, the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") will continue to celebrate Agents and Operations, focusing on large scale strategic ops, the incredibly complex execution of Anomalies and more.

Continue to share those Operations that you have found most memorable and would like to see in next week's Ingress Report using [#IngressYearTwo](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressYearTwo "") on Google+ and Facebook.

News emerged this week that Susanna Moyer and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") will be present at the [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Finale in Charleston, SC on December 13th, and that the brilliant but unstable Dr. +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "") will be present at the [#Darsana](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Darsana "") Finale in Barcelona.
