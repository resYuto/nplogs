What is RedX?

A series of leaked e-mails traversing across the globe from +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") employee Antoine Smith to both a high-tech scanner device manufacturer and the disavowed Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe reveals the existence of a classified project, titled 'RedX.'

**At this point in time, it's difficult to know exactly what RedX might be, although I welcome your speculation. What is clear to me from this leaked intelligence, however, is that if Mr. Lynton-Wolfe intends to obtain these prototype devices from the Fort-Worth manufacturing facility on the 16th of November, he may also attempt to engage with and exploit the ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** Anomaly in neighboring Dallas that day. Agents on the ground there should keep an eye out for him. There's something else. Dr. Lynton-Wolfe is nothing if not a target. The presence of this intel means that those who have an interest in extracting revenge or preventing him from engaging in further research now have a time and a place.** 

Worrying, as is Lynton-Wolfe's exploitation of Smith's DarkXM affected state of decay.

A passcode to those who enrich our discussion today.
