In this Special Edition of the Ingress Report, +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") looks back on the last two years of the Niantic Investigation, focusing this week on the struggle between +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") and ADA for the Ancient Artifacts during Recursion, as well as the events that led up to it.

Join the Ingress Report next week for a continuing journey through the shared world discovered by and affected by each and every Ingress Agent, as Susanna looks back to cover the events of Interitus and Helios and how they led us to Darsana.

On this day, today, tweet [#Ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Ingress "") in 7 words at 9AM to help unlock Gold, Platinum, and Onyx tiers for the Innovator Medal, and extend double AP for an additional week.

Good luck, Agents.
