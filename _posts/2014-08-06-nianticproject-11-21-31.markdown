The +[Society for the Ethical Treatment of AIs](https://plus.google.com/107293393622139455503 ""), an organization created by +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") to create awareness about and formulate a strategy against the threat posed by advanced AIs like ADA, shared this article earlier today.

It seems the great thinkers of our age are tuning in to the imminent threat posed to the species by artificial super-intelligence.

Some days ago, +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") shared an article that pointedly stated that, unless a dramatic change in human behavior emerges, our species will be responsible for a mass extinction on the scale of asteroid impacts.

It seems, whether benevolent or terrifying, our future paths are interwoven with the intelligences we have already created and will create. Which road will we travel? Remains to be seen.
