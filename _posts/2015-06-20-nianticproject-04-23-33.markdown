+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") has confirmed that she is on the ground in Portland.

Will the ‪#‎Persepolis‬ Anomaly there affect her like the one following the events of ‪#‎TimeZero‬ did?

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>Yes. I'm here in Portland.<br /><br />It's an odd feeling. The memories are there, but I feel detached from them. More like watching a movie than living an experience.<br /><br />I know what many are thinking. Last time I was here, being near the Anomaly affected me. Yeah, it did. Will it this time? I don't know. <br /><br />I don't have a strong opinion if it does or doesn't. I want to stop seeing the movie. I want to reconnect to the parts of me that... I don't know that I lost... but certainly that I have become distanced from.<br /><br />I'm a sensitive. I've learned to accept that. I have a feeling folks like me are drawn to Anomalies like moths to the flame. We know it might burn us. But being surrounded by the energy there. It's where we belong.<br /><br />I'll see many of you at <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis">#Persepolis</a> tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to it.<br /><br /></div>
