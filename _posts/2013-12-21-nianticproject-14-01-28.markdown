What is enoch channeling this time?

+[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "")Â has unveiled a new track for our consideration.

Titled 'translation,' he's framed it only with a brief and cryptic haiku:

*the synapses fire,*
*finding a perfect new home.*
*this is translation.*

In addition to releasing the mastered audio and a video of the track on Youtube, he's once again released isolated tracks of each instrument for all creative Investigators out there to create new remixes with and share via the [#TuneIngress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23TuneIngress "") hashtag. These are on his Soundcloud page at: [https://soundcloud.com/enoch-dalby](https://soundcloud.com/enoch-dalby "")

**The obvious answer to my above question is there for all of us to see. For those who remember, the visuals enoch has chosen are startlingly similar to what we saw in early ADA Calibration videos from the Niantic Project. The question is, what is enoch trying to say here? What does it mean for Klue and ADA? I personally find the music beautiful: pulsing, harmonic and exploratory. Does enoch believe that the ADA and Klue amalgam is a positive force? How does this reckon with his previous music serving to channel the message of Jarvis? Is enoch positioning himself as a fulcrum between the two Faction ideologues, or is he simply a free thinker, going where the inspiration takes him?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
