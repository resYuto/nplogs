Took a while to hike there. It was like a time capsule of the cold war, superimposed with Yuri’s tech. Nothing there. If Yuri had an important message to send, either it wasn’t there or somebody else had gotten there before I did. I seriously doubt that. The Anazktec know me, they don’t know the others, and what they lack in hardware, they make up for with an absoluteness connection to their environment... invisible and inaudible. Nobody would have been allowed in there without their knowledge or permission. Such an intrusion would be bloody. ", "<br />", "<br />", "The Anazktec indicated that they had had strange dreams of Yuri.
