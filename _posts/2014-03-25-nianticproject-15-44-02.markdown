+[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "") has released the final track of his first EP since the dissolution of the Niantic Project.

The track, entitled 'Shaped,' is contemplative and complex; neither overwhelmingly positive nor cynical.

I had previously viewed +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "") as having an Enlightened point of view. Now, I'm not so sure. 

Perhaps he is truly neutral-- an artist seeing both ideals and using their conflict to fuel his work. 

Or perhaps he remains Enlightened. If so, it's refreshing to see an influencer whose message remains calm and thoughtful.

A sharp contrast to the most recent message from Roland Jarvis.
