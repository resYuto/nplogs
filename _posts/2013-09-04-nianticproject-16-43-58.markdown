It's been a while since we heard from Ken Owen.

From the NIA, working under then director Yuen Ni on the ill-fated Niantic Project, to Hazdata after the Niantic Takeover, and then back to the NIA after their work was done, his ability to remain employed no matter who's in charge is probably a testament to his mastery of spin.

It's not the first time we've heard this conversation. Last time, Owen was singing praise for his 'hide in the spotlight' strategy. As far as I can see, it's worked. While the mainstream media has occasionally chanced upon the Ingress Scanner Technology, the fact of the transdimensional Shaper Ingress has remained something confined to hushed conversation and what they colloquially refer to as the Fringe Media, folks like myself and Susanna Moyer.

**The real meat of this transcript, though, lay on its perimeter: Jay Phillips' vehement denial of any NIA association with Susanna Moyer, and Owen's mention of plans to disrupt the Ingress Report's credibility. The louder they deny things, the more I grow suspect. It leads to an interesting series of questions... Who has means, motive and opportunity to disrupt and inject messages into the Ingress Report? I'm looking to build a list of plausible suspects so we can investigate further.**

A passcode, as always, to those who contribute thoughtfully to our discussion today.Â
