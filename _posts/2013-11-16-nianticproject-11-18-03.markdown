Two of the RedX devices have been spirited away to Vienna. 

Two, presumably, remain in Dallas, where Oliver Lynton-Wolfe is expected to collect them in person tomorrow. The likelihood of him making himself visible for the Anomaly seems high.

Despite the growing pantheon of enemies this man has accumulated, if history tells us anything, it's that the Sensitives are attracted to Anomalies like moths to a flame. Perhaps it's a byproduct of the XM mega-dose they received on Epiphany Night; being near the Anomaly sites may allow them to revisit that moment of pure unbridled potential.

As for the who and the why of the RedX devices heading to Vienna, like Smith I am clueless, for now. What I do know from some chatter in the intel circles is that Lynton-Wolfe intended to use all four devices as conduits to coordinate the tracking and destruction of the Jarvis shards with those who are backing his bid to become a new leader of the Enlightened Faction. 

**I am curious: Do any members of the Enlightened see Lynton-Wolfe as a viable leader, ideological or otherwise, for the Enlightened, or is his plan simply delusional? Roland Jarvis may have been the first vocal Enlightened, but I've never really understood whether he was a 'leader' or merely a philosophical paragon. What about those of you who believe in the path of Resistance? What value does Lynton-Wolfe's plan (delusional or otherwise) serve the Resistance cause?**

Regardless of the answers, it seems that those Agents who hope to exploit the conduits to the perhaps delusional but undoubtedly brilliant Dr. Oliver Lynton-Wolfe will need to get their hands on the RedX devices as soon as possible.

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights, references and opinions.
