"My mind was seeing a thousand things every second. I yanked out my notebook to try and put some of the ideas down, but they were coming too fast. It was overwhelming." - +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "")Â 

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Was passing by this Portal today.<br /><br />I swear I felt the energy from it rip right into me -- it was as if it had been seeking me out.<br /><br />I've always felt a little more... mentally active around Portals, but this was something else.<br /><br />My mind was seeing a thousand things every second. I yanked out my notebook to try and put some of the ideas down, but they were coming too fast. It was overwhelming.<br /><br />Has this happened to anyone else recently? Are the Portals getting stronger, or was this isolated to me? Either way... I need to figure out why.<br /><br /></div>
