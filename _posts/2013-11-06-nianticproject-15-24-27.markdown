If I was hearing it for the first time, I would share their shock.

+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") has been a victim of her circumstances, and perhaps her own ambition, in the past.

This video released today witnesses something that happened on the day of the [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") Anomaly in Atlanta.

It seems to me that Devra's presence at the Anomaly there may have been a facade, a cover for a meeting that took place that day behind layers of closed doors and secrecy at the Centers for Disease Control.

**It's difficult to know where to place Devra after everything that she has been through and done. From her ethical disagreements at Niantic, to her questionable testing of mass-dose XM on humans while at ****+[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "")****, to this. She's either the most morally malleable scientist I've ever come across, or she's playing everyone, and we just haven't figured out what her game is yet. I welcome your analysis and interpretations.**

A passcode to those who enrich our discussion with meaningful insight, references, and speculation.
