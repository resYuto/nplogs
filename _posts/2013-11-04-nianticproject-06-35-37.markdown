The final pages from +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "")'s record of the CERN showdown between Operatives from +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""), +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 ""), the NIA and HAZDATA.

Investigator +[Mustafa Said](https://plus.google.com/101807696742019624768 "") yesterday accused me of understating the value of this document, suggesting I needed a better description than 'riveting.'

I'll bite. These remaining pages from the document are as revelatory as the first set.

As with the previous pages, unknown details come to the fore in a deluge of gunfire, tension, ferocity and cunning.

**In addition to revealing information about the programmer involved in the assembly of ADA from Omnivore components, Henry Bowles, the pages reveal how the scientists Martin Schubert, ****+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")**** and ****+[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "")**** were spirited out of the ill-fated facility. Do you believe that these scientists are currently involved with any of the Corporations, or have they gone their own ways? If so, who is working for whom? In addition what threats against ADA are we now aware of that previously were hidden, and how might they manifest in the future?**
