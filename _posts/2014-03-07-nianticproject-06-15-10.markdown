[#### photo: Agents,
We have obtained a document produced by Andy Nominus. Some tried to stop us from releasing this.
You have come far by finishing the Access Dive. Some competed. Others collaborated, sharing their victories with those from the other faction. Now, you have a new challenge.
It will take collaboration across factions and across the world to bring the pieces of this document together. Share a public post with the hashtag #nominus  to receive an asset redemption code if you find a piece in your area.
It's in your hands now. Find the pieces. You must bring this document to light.
Good luck.
