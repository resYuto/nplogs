A thought provoking question from +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 ""):

Can +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") not see +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "")'s actions as she works to end the bond between them, or is this in fact something that ADA desires as well?

I wonder if it's a little bit of both...
