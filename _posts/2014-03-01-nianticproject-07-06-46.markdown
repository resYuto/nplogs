Most interesting.

Someone in Karachi, Pakistan came across a lost camera from +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") Nomad shoot.

I've chatted with him directly and confirmed that it is real, but haven't been able to persuade him to release the contents.

I think he's holding out for some monetary compensation...

According to him, the footage on the device 'must be seen to be believed.'
