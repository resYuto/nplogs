As I suspected, the piece of writing that emerged yesterday was part of something much larger. Here are the three remaining pages, discovered in 6 separate fragments around the world.

Many Agents rose to the challenge to help assemble these pages, and the details of their recovery have been thoroughly documented by +[Thomas Arteaga](https://plus.google.com/103802168927018055875 "") here: [https://goo.gl/EslFKo](https://goo.gl/EslFKo "")

Among those who assisted are +[Ana Prados](https://plus.google.com/107808734448932102456 ""), +[Andrea Innocenti](https://plus.google.com/102507842357547305021 ""), +[Daniel van Os](https://plus.google.com/109210061029583643688 ""), +[Dyi Wong](https://plus.google.com/101220630711584881413 ""), +[Hiroki Ogawa](https://plus.google.com/101579283300523363583 ""), +[Jack Lim](https://plus.google.com/115777912557576772285 ""), +[Marco Simonelli](https://plus.google.com/109884475769585065373 ""), +[Michael Finley](https://plus.google.com/109760740377771270957 ""), +[Nuno Virgílio Rocha](https://plus.google.com/103698956338383619548 ""), +[Rajesh Manjunath](https://plus.google.com/107277577489152120570 ""), +[Varun Verma](https://plus.google.com/105372384584545587642 ""), +[Yik Sheng Lee](https://plus.google.com/101571290960297943734 "") and Agents @juamps, @euscadis and @payday.

The fragments of Page 2 were found at the Saint-Jaques Tower in Paris, France and the Primidé De Mayo in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Page 3's fragments were found at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, MO, USA and the Hawa Maahal in Jaipur, India.

The last page was assembled from fragments recovered at the Coliseum in Rome, Italy and the Tokyo Tower in Tokyo, Japan.

Excellent work, Agents - a truly global collaboration.

I believe we now hold the entirety of this piece of writing. +[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 ""): Care to comment on whether this is something you've been working on?
