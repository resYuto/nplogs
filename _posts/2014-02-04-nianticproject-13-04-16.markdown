Hidden inside the new music released by +[enoch dalby](https://plus.google.com/114348053832535597563 "") yesterday was a warning to the Enlightened explorer, +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "").

Within the spectrograph of one of the individual tracks, an encoded URL led to this document. Read between the lines, and you'll see that someone, and I think I know who, is playing a dangerous game with one of the most important XM researchers around.

**Who's behind this, and why? Why does Hank Johnson represent a threat and why go to such extreme measures to stop him? What do you think the fallout of this will be?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
