"I don't know what [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") is, but ADA knew something about the Niantic Researchers that she wouldn't tell me." - +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") 

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2> <br />One of the things ADA and I discussed often was the nature of reality. An existential sort of topic for an AI, but it was something she was interested in.<br /><br />I was at a disadvantage during those conversations. I knew that there were parts of her that I could not see. Memories and information that she had chosen to withhold. I don't know if I had that same power over her. Perhaps all of me was known.<br /><br />A possibility that she suggested was that all the layers of reality were connected, possibly through something like what Roland Jarvis has called the Ultimate. <br /><br />What I'm trying to get at is... if every part of our universe is connected, then the connections can be found. If the connections can be found, perhaps they can be traversed.<br /><br />I don't know what <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a> is, but ADA knew something about the Niantic Researchers that she wouldn't tell me. They are all locked together in the labyrinth of the Portal Network. I wonder what would happen if they could find their way out.<br /><br /></div>
