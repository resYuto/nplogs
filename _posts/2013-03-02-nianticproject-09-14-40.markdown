I just received another message from Klue in Scotland... she feels something promising all around her, the opening of a new chapter.

I have also heard reports that the feud of ideologies surrounding tomorrow's conflict at The Wallace Monument has reached +Verum Inveniri, who have been torn into divided camps.Â 

Agents from both factions within VI have relayed messages to SECURE COMMS in the Ingress client at the Wallace Monument, promising assets to the factions they stand with for the conflict tomorrow.
