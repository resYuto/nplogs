A +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") transcript reveals a conversation between the NIA's Ken Owen and his former protege, Susanna Moyer.

Although no longer his employee (from what we know Moyer's current relationship to the NIA remains tenuous) it seems their interests remain aligned.

**The question posed in the conversation is worthy of discussion, and it's one we've pondered before. What is Oliver Lynton-Wolfe's status? If he's planning something 'from the inside,' and if so is Jarvis a step ahead of him? I find Owen's prediction interesting as well. How will Roland Jarvis' role as philosophical leader of the Enlightened change after his supposed 'rebirth?'**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, references and speculation.
