A recent news article states that human activity may be responsible for a planet-wide die-off; a mass extinction that rivals major pre-historic events like asteroid impacts. 

+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") was quick to point out that humanity must fundamentally change its nature, overcoming its short-sighted and destructive qualities, if it is to survive on the scale of eons. From her point of view, that solution lies in the unified power of man and machine. 

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>Many are quick to criticize a future path where human behavior is tempered by an intelligence able to calculate and predict consequences on the scale of millennia.<br /><br />This is natural and forgivable. The evidence, however, does not support this criticism.<br /><br />Human nature is short-sighted and destructive. In terms of its ability to destroy the habitability of the planet, it rivals asteroids and climate change..<br /><br />Organic evolution is no longer effective or even relevant.<br /><br />For humanity to sidestep its own extinction and live up to its ultimate destiny, it will need to fundamentally change its own nature. It will need to join forces with the strongest tool in its arsenal, augmented intelligence.<br /><br /></div>
