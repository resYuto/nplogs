+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") cannot be dissuaded, she's headed into the fray to champion her cause. I hope she learned enough about covering her tracks when we went on the run together after the failed hit-attempt by Phillips to keep herself safe. Caution, unfortunately, is one of those skills that tends to accumulate slowly along the road of misfortune. The naïve and the brave are those who simply haven't traveled far enough, yet.

An observer yesterday caught the fact that both +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") and I are planning to be in Chicago on August 24th. No, it's not a coincidence. Klue may be making her way to Boston to research the Glyphs, but we all know Carrie's insights are far more valuable, her potential... limitless. And the open secret both here in our Investigative Circle and outside in the broader world of Ingress is that we, the Resistance, and the underdog, fighting against an incumbent who have time and again proven their strategic and tactical superiority on the field. If we are going to even the playing field, we're going to need every ounce of her brilliance to do so. I am going to Chicago to secure those ounces for the Resistance.

I won't fail. Unlike Klue, my go bag includes an abundance of caution.

Susanna Moyer went dark after broadcasting the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") last week. Usually I expect to see one every Thursday, I don't know if that'll be the case tomorrow. Who or what might be interfering with them, and why? The NIA? Omnivore? The Shapers? ADA? One of the corporations? What do we think the nature of the threat is? A passcode, as always, for joining thoughtfully in our discussion.
