VI report that [#deaddropday](https://plus.google.com/s/%23deaddropday "") has been a resounding success. Most of the dead drops have been recovered, although there are a few still left for the adventurous and the brave among you.

Congrats to those who recovered dead drops, and the many who gained access to the Ingress Scanner technology yesterday and today.

Today, more from Hank Johnson's Congo Files.Â
