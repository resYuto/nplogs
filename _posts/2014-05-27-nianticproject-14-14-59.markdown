At the end of last week's [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""), a familiar figure emerged. We know that man only as 'Azmati,' an associate of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s from his military days.

Between that and the surveillance imagery discovered at the tail of the episode, which many have posited could be Hank Johnson, my feeling is that in the coming days Azmati will play a critical role in the Viator's plan to escape his fate.

In the old world, this would be when we clear a large table in the center of the room,  open the filing cabinets and create a stack of intel to pore over. Over a tall cup of coffee or several, we'd drill down into the details of everything we know about Azmati in order to prepare ourselves for what's to come and answer the tricky questions.

I'm hoping to create the digital equivalent of that moment. This thread is the table. I call on all fellow Investigators: Open your filing cabinets. What do we know of Azmati, his relationship to Hank Johnson and his role in Hank's 'death?'

What documents have we uncovered thus far that enable us to see this picture in complete resolution?

Based on all this intel, what role might Azmati be playing in Hank's [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")?
