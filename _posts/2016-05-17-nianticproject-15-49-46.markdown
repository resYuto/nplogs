<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>What separates us from ADA? I don't know if we'll ever be able to answer that question, but Jahan narrows the scope in her own evaluation.

What do you think?<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
