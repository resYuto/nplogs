Martin Schubert has been in the news at the periphery of our world recently. After being released from the Niantic Facility in Geneva, the word was that Ilya Pevtstov was attempting to convince him to join +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "") at the helm of +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "")'s XM Development program. 

A recent push by +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") into German territory, activating thousands of Vodafone stores as Portals, increased the heat of the conflict between these two towering giants in the world of XM technology.

This research top-sheet, likely written in the final days of Schubert's stay at Niantic courtesy of the NIA and Hazdata, casts light on a topic we've discussed before, the effects of XM and Shaping on us.

In the environment of Operation [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra ""), however, the document takes on new light. We have to step back and view this not as how XM and Shaping might impact an individual, but how it might change an entire institution.

**That is my question for you all today. We've always held the idea that XM and Shaping can not change the quintissential 'you,' it merely enhances the capabilities and potential you always had. A scientist could become a great scientist, but a scientist may not be able to become a master pianist. Is there a deeper element at play in the Enlightenment's push to saturate global powercenters in XM... Is there a way to control the direction in which an individual or institution is shaped, and might the glyphs or some other mechanism play a role? A passcode, as always, to thoughtful contributors.**
