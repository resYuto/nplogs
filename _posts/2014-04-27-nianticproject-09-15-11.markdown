What does [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") mean?

We've seen glimpses of this moment before, a conversation between ADA and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") revealing just what the AI has in play for the future of Humanity. There's more to be learned, but even this alone is staggering, 

It also leads me to a deeper question...

Who captured this video, how did they do it, and why did they send it to me?
