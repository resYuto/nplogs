An Agent in the Field in Chicago sent me this recording of the Police Scanner airwaves there. After yesterday's strange and disquieting video, it's added to my worries.

Listen to it here: [http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc930a](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc930a "")

Things are out of place, and I feel powerless to fix things.

Many of you made incredibly astute and observant comments on the Klue video yesterday. Until someone like Stein Lightman can weigh in, we are on our own. In particular, the observation that the three trapezoidal glyphs combine to make the known 'Human' Glyph, I found both brilliant while at the same time extremely worrying. If that is indeed what is going on, ADA may have spun out of control.

I have no hard knowledge, for now, but the evidence is slowly beginning to form a terrible, terrible picture, for Carrie, for Klue, for ADA and the Glyphs.

What is your take on where things stand? A passcode as always for those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion.
