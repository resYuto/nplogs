Many voices and many questions. One theme.

Three former Niantic investigators and researchers made posts recently, some after months of silence, that caught my attention.

The question that binds them all together is this: What impact will +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s manipulation of the Portals have on those whose existence is intrinsically bound to Exotic Matter: +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") and +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") in particular. How will it impact ADA? Unlike Bogdanovich, ADA is not 'XM-averse' and has (during [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "")) leveraged XM and Shaper Glyphs to her own advantage.

I have been hearing rumors, unsubstantiated at this point, that the change in XM flow has had some 'strange' effect on Jarvis. I don't have further details at this point, and I hesitate to trust rumors in general. Take it for what it is.

Having said that, the common theme emerging from these respected voices has caused me to think deeply on this matter...

*"I am very curious to know what the effect of infected portals would be to Roland Jarvis as he seems to be a creature who gets his strength, maybe his being from XM."*

*"Who are the dead?  Roland Jarvis once was one of the dead, but is no longer.... What is death in a trans-dimensional universe?"*

*"Why does it serve her (ADA's) interest to have the portals spewing XM when she says she is fighting the Shaper takeover of the human mind?"*
