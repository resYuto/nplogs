A leaked chatlog from the Niantic Project today breaks news of three upcoming anomalies. Two on 03/09 and 03/16 in Austin, TX and one on 03/16 in Lake Geneva, WI.

Misty Hannah, the magician, seems to be involved. I'll post an update as soon as I've processed the details. Keep your ears to the ground, truthseekers.Â
