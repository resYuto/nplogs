The previous day has been an exception, with voices from across Factions, across Corporate rivalries, and from long periods of dormancy emerging to enter +[Carrie Campbell](https://plus.google.com/101180225942784917383 "") into memory.

It's a moment of calm, I think, in an otherwise divided and conflicted time. Tomorrow, we will remember our differences and the struggles will begin again. Today, we are united in the knowledge that a great mind, perhaps one of the greatest when it comes to her field, has left this plane.

*In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni* - A Latin palindrome... We enter the circle at night and are consumed by fire. It's said to describe the behavior of moths. For some reason, I find it resonates more widely for me.

We are entering a new chapter of our world. One where those who guide us through the night do so at great risk to themselves. We will need to find in ourselves Carrie's courage and her remarkable intelligence to avoid being consumed by the fire as she was.

In this new chapter, I wish us all luck.

**Carrie Campbell was a semiotician. Someone who at explored symbols, language and the mechanics of communication and the expression of ideas at the very deepest levels of perception. If we are to continue to explore the Shaper Glyphs and build our knowledge base in that area, who, if anyone at all, will pick up that torch and lead us deeper? That is my question for you today.**

A passcode, as always, to those who contribute meaningfully to our conversation.
