<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Agents from both Factions lent our Investigation a hand today in San Diego. The Enlightened were the first to complete the mission, and Resistance Agents recovered some of the missing fragments to help us get a complete picture of the attack on the Enlightened compound. To all those who were on the ground, and to those who helped organize, energize and analyze its fallout: You have my gratitude.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
