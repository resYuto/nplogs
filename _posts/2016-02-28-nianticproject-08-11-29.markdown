[#IngressObsidian](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressObsidian "") Milwaukee Final Measurement Report. Resistance control this Anomaly, 1566 to 444.

At the start of the day, the Resistance faced an uphill battle to make up for a steep loss in Hamamatsu. With each successive Anomaly they have chipped away at the deficit. In Milwaukee, the Resistance continued this trend. As Milwaukee came to an end, the result netted them an extra 1122 points over their Enlightened counterparts. The Enlightened have lost some of their early advantage, but Seattle, with 72 Shards at stake, remains very much in play. At the most recent Jump Window just a few moments ago, the Enlightened had captured an additional 2 Shards, bringing their total to 33 vs. 10 for the Resistance.
