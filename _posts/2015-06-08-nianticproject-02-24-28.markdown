Looks like our friend +[Tycho C.](https://plus.google.com/106965960712090580437 "")Â has been keeping himself busy.

Not sure if this is a series of new posters, another comic or perhaps a graphic novel?

I'll keep you posted as I learn more...

In the meantime, does anyone know what we're looking at here?
