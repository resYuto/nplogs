+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") begins to share some of his story from the [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "") to today.

I'm not even slightly surprised that he's already off on another journey. He's always been a step ahead of us in uncovering the mysteries around us.

There's a reason he calls himself a Nomad, and they call him the Viator.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Forgive me for being out of contact.  Yes that was me with Calvin at the FOB.<br /><br />An IQTech operative found me and got me to the base. <br /><br />In June of this year I awoke in what I thought to be Afghanistan, 2010... disoriented, confused and generally achy. <br /><br />Fortunately, I came upon and started following a trail of messages that I had left for myself. They led me back to familiar places, and slowly brought with them an understanding of my <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion">#Recursion</a>. These little clues joined together to form a bridge across the lost time, from 2010 to here and now.<br /><br />I found enough of them to piece things back together, but I suspect there are more out there... breadcrumbs leading to memories, connections and realizations that a different self wanted to remind me of. <br /><br />I hope that they do not fall into the wrong hands. <br /><br />For now, I am now on a different journey... an important one,  and one I'm choosing to go on alone.<br /><br />I will keep you abreast of it in upcoming entries.<br /><br />Hank<br /><br /></div>
