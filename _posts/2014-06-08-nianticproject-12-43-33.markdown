+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), clearly relieved after the outcome of [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") 05 and the incredible Linking Operation undertaken by Enlightened Agents to support him, expresses his gratitude.

He is not without concerns for the days that lie ahead, but today, I'm sure he and those supporting him are rejoicing.

+[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""), meanwhile, has a more scathing opinion of what has taken place. A recent update on his G+ profile makes it clear that, in face of the threat he feels ADA and the [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") represents, Hank's priorities are wrong.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I am grateful and relieved. Since I learned of my condition, the idea of losing every moment since I returned from Afghanistan after my death has weighed upon me. Time is finite, and each moment is precious to me.  Every shred of knowledge critical in understanding the threat, or perhaps the opportunity, that now confronts us.<br /><br />The plan executed today which stored some of my history, harvested from Portals around the world, within the Portal at the Robert E. Howard house in Cross Plains, is not by itself the solution. It is, however, the catalyst for one. <br /><br />Significant challenges lie ahead. I am fortunate to have friends who will continue this struggle. They have my trust and my gratitude.<br /><br />Hank Johnson<br />June 7, 2014<br /><br /></div>

The plan executed today which stored some of my history, harvested from Portals around the world, within the Portal at the Robert E. Howard house in Cross Plains, is not by itself the solution. It is, however, the catalyst for one.
Significant challenges lie ahead. I am fortunate to have friends who will continue this struggle. They have my trust and my gratitude.
