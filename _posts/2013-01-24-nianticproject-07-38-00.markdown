News this morning of an impending change to the Ingress scanner tech.

In addition, I received a bundle of leaked emails and memos tracking Hank Johnson's journey into the Congo after he left the Niantic facility in late November.

I'm still sorting through everything, but I'll be sharing them with the investigative community as I piece them together.

It's a fascinating journey.Â
