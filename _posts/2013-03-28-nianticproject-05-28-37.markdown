As we prepare for the expected Misty Hannah hyperthreading phenomenon to begin in Los Angeles, I received this tapped phone call.

In the moments following Misty's escape from the lab on 03/16, a payphone near her began to ring. It was ADA. They had a short conversation, and then Misty appeared before the agents in Austin.
