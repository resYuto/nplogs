One of +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "")'s sources sent her a warning. Looks like we were right when we flagged +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") as the likely perpetrator in the Vegas hit at the beginning of February.

This transcript confirms that the body discovered was Lucky Louie. It seems that fears that this may have been a coverup of a hit on +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") were unfounded.

A relief, although there have been other warning signs.

**The transcript seems to circle around a previous conflict between Misty and the man named Potts. Do we have any other evidence to shed light on their relationship? Misty's been silent for a long time... Who is she, exactly? What do we know about her?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
