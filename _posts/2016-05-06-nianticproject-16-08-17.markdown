<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>The source who has been dropping information about the mission at UC San Diego this weekend just sent this heavily redacted document my way. I also learned some additional details about what's going down on Saturday, which I've added to a G+ Event page to make things easier to keep track of. <br /><br /><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ce8eo3nslve7l83dm9qg5k41gas" class="ot-anchor">https://plus.google.com/events/ce8eo3nslve7l83dm9qg5k41gas</a><br /><br />Given the source, I suspect this document and event in San Diego are connected. I'll be keeping an eye on this, hopefully Agents on the ground can help us piece this together.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
