+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") stands at the helm of the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport ""), bringing fresh intel about the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomalies and the ten +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") Researchers whose fates lie entangled within them.

A single researcher will be connected to each Anomaly, and by controlling the Researchers, the Factions will be able to gain control of the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") series as a whole.

Join the struggle for [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon ""). Find an Anomaly near you at [ingress.com/events](http://ingress.com/events ""), or help drive the Global MU up for your Faction.

Mission Days are just around the corner, on October 17th and 31st.

Epic sitreps from around the world get the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") treatment, including Operation Terrapin, Lucky Polar Bear, Smurf the Earth, Operation Chaos, OPauliteiros, SunkenSardinia, Harvest, Urban Monsoon and many, many more.

Share your epic Sitreps on Google+ and Facebook using [#Ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Ingress ""), and be sure to capture your adventure with photos and video.
