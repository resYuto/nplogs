We've often speculated on +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "")'s past... and evidence revealing her history occasionally comes to light despite her every effort to keep it concealed.

It seems one evening, perhaps after a day shooting the Ingress Report, she allowed her defenses to slip. Someone from her team convinced her to begin to reveal her past to him, and he captured it on a portable recording device.

One thing I've learned is that once something has been captured on tape, disk or in any kind of medium, it becomes almost impossible to undo.

This recording reveals, among other things, how Susanna was first recruited to the NIA.

**What does this new information tell us about Susanna's character and personality? Does it change your opinion about her, or help you understand her better?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
