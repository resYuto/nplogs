As the first Persepolis Anomaly approaches, a pattern containing the identity of +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") appears to be manifesting within the Portal Network. +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") shares exclusive details about a window of volatility that is expected to last until the end of the Persepolis Anomalies.

In Washington D.C., Agents will be able to take part in the +[GORUCK HQ](https://plus.google.com/105041353271604909960 "") Light Challenge during the first [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomaly in order to obtain key Volatile Portal information for their Factions.

Last week, the Agent-run interview show, +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 ""), celebrated their 1st year anniversary. Susanna Moyer joined them for a candid interview about the Niantic Investigation and more.

The insurance group, AXA, has created a new video to remind Agents everywhere to protect that which they hold dearest.

In Tech News, a new statistic called the Current Hack Streak will allow Agents to track their progress as they attempt to obtain the Sojourner Medal. In addition, the emergence of the Lightman Shards may be the cause of a temporary instability in the Portal Network. During the next week, it appears that AP for all actions may be increased and Portals may produce more Ultrastrikes than normal.

Agents around the world continued to inspire with their incredible Sitreps: From Stockholm, Operation 101. From Norway, Operation Varangersøm. From Groningen, a massive layered Field Operation. From Millford, MA, Operation No Trespassing. From Brazil, Operation Grahla Azul and from Indonesia, Operation Berlian.

In Linz, Austria, over 250 Agents took part in the first ever Mission Day, a series of coordinated missions designed in conjunction with the Austrian Tourist corporation, Oberösterreich. 

Keep an eye open for a Mission Day near you soon. The next Ingress First Saturday is also just around the corner, on May 2nd. Find one to attend at [ingress.com/events](http://ingress.com/events "").

A surveillance audio recording reveals that the Acolyte is hiding something at a Cabin on the Enlightened compound established by +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""). Does the cabin hide Roland's body, or is the Acolyte harboring a dark secret of her own?
