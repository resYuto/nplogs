<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>Just received this from Anne. If anybody has any contact with Scott, please notify me. This is very significant. I'm really worried about Klue. I think it is becoming evident to all of us that Scott is a very high level sensitive who has become aware of things that certain people would rather stay hidden. The secrets of the cabin is out now, and there's probably going to be hell to pay.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
