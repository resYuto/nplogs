+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") and her  [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "")  team were able to recover this video-diary of +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s recent travels.

His narration reveals the trouble the man is facing, battling inner demons and a deep sense of confusion.

This phrase seems to follow me around: Something is very wrong.

This time, a man I have tremendous respect for, Hank Johnson, seems to be in the thick of that ever-unfolding chaos.

**What is happening to him? ****+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")****, ****+[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "")****, ****+[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "")**** and even Roland Jarvis... many are talking about him in cryptic whispers and parables. What do they know? What secrets are they hiding?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
