Where is Roland Jarvis, and what is he up to?

We haven't heard much from the philosophical paragon of the Enlightened since his return to the physical plane, but it appears the he and Dr. +[Oliver Lynton-Wolfe](https://plus.google.com/108200572857719809031 "") share a concern with some other voices we've heard from recently, like +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") and +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 ""): +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""). The wanderer who may be lost. 

Rumors are surfacing of a video-diary documenting Hank's travels in Europe. I've yet to obtain it, but I have an ear to the ground. My hope is it may shed further light on the situation.

**In the meantime, how does this conversation help us understand what's happening with the Viator? What is his condition? Does anyone have any information about the 'Artifacts' being mentioned? We heard about them in another conversation as well...**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
