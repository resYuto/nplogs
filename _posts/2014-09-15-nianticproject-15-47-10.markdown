The clock ticks, and the TS/METIS files continue to trickle in. It's my hope that we'll see the remaining files before time runs out. A source informed me that on Monday, at Midnight UTC, the packets will cease to emerge from the Portals.

One of the most fascinating slides to emerge from this series has been this one. ADA's family tree.Â 

Her roots go back past Omnivore. As she digs deeper into her own heritage, I wonder what she will find.
