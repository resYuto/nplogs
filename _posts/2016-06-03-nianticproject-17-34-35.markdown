<div class="shared"><br /><h2>H. Richard Loeb</h2>The Acolyte is troubled by Hank's relationship to Jahan. <br /><br />It's a fair concern, but Hank's doubts are well placed as well... did the Acolyte really have Klue's best interests in mind? <br /><br />She used the Enlightened victory to help Jarvis reach into Klue's mind for the fragments left behind by ADA, but can we trust her description of how things really went down? <br /><br />Why won't the Acolyte let Hank talk to Klue?<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23InvestigateIngress">#InvestigateIngress</a><br /><br /></div>
