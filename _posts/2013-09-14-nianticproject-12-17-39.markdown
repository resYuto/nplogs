Dr. +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") has been busy, and has added a dozen previously unidentified or ambiguous Glyphs to the growing collection of peer-verified Glyphs on his Google+ page.

A number of questions come to mind as I gaze across this growing body of knowledge.

**What are we going to do, now and in the future, as we continue to unlock the complexities of this language? What purpose does it serve? Why does this language exist in the form it exists, if it even can be called a language, and why do some of the Glyphs look the way they do? It's a topic filled with intricacies, and I'm fascinated by all the possible answers.**

A passcode to those who contribute meaningfully to our discussion, as always. <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>Thank you Agents and Investigators, for your help in collecting and debating the meaning of these recently discovered Glyphs. Your discussions often (especially in the case of Mind, Body and Spirit, and Create/Creation) were extremely valuable in this process.<br /><br />After extensive research and discussion with my peers, I am confident to present these new findings to the Investigative Community.<br /><br /></div>
