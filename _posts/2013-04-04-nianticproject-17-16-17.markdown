To turn the outcome in your faction's favor: Capture the key highlighted portal in a field, the outermost field dominates.

Failing that, capture majority of the 15 contributing portals.

The anomaly will be measured 5 times. At 5:02PM, 5:32PM, 6:02PM, 6:32PM and 7:02PM. The anomaly state at each and all of those 5 times will be taken into account.
