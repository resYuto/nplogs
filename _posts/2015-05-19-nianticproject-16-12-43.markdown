Is this true? It seems possible...A member of +[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "") claims to have come upon this document during her research about Dr. +[Edgar Allan Wright](https://plus.google.com/110289508116377658380 "").

It seems that very little is known of Dr. Wright's history... if you have any information about his past, please share it. It's my hope that as a community we can reassemble the history of this enigmatic and influential figure.
