There was a flood of activity on +[Thomas Greanias](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902 "")'  Google+ page ( [https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902/posts](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902/posts "") ) yesterday. Close to 1000 comments, and many interesting answers from the author on the four interview threads. He seemed cagey but also quite in-the-know on a number of topics, if you read between the lines. Another author we've been tracking also made an appearance...

Earlier today, +Joe Philley started a thread ( [https://plus.google.com/107179591490960059904/posts/fFGvTNdnoXi](https://plus.google.com/107179591490960059904/posts/fFGvTNdnoXi "") ), challenging the assumption that the document leaked on April 1st was a hoax, and that the Niantic Project may actually be beginning the process of shuttering their operation. Interesting observations there, as well.

I received a document today revealing the confusion and conflict inside the Niantic Labs on the eve of Misty's disappearance. It seems oddly prescient. One thing is for certain, everything changed that night...
