I rely on friends out in the field to keep the investigation going. 

Ben Jackland was spotted by a NIA surveillance team recently when I asked him to check in on the Chrome stores. 

If you remember, some time ago they were being used as dead drops. It seems Niantic Labs has been releasing patches for both factions to the stores. What is their role in all this? Whose side are they on? Or do they have ulterior motives...
