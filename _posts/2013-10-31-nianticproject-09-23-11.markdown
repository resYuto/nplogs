I discovered this digging through some of PAC's old archival material.

Unsure of it's origin, it could be pre-Niantic, or it could have been recorded while he was working at the Project.

It's a fascinating and intimate retelling of the story from his youth that we've seen and heard in a few different places before: The crash of the experimental jet outside his childhood home.

**Listening to this, I'm struck by the transition and the journey this man has had over the last year. Does the Roland Jarvis in the Portals feel like the same person to you, or someone vastly different? As we rush towards the next series of ****[#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "")**** Anomalies, which at this point I think we are all certain revolve somehow around Jarvis, which Jarvis are we fighting against and for? The man with the strange but compelling childhood story, or the grandiose visionary who compares himself to Osiris with metaphors of rebirth?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with their meaningful contributions and insights.
