Following [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Portland, +[H. Richard Loeb](https://plus.google.com/117506125229608138804 "") reports that +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 "") has gone radio silent.

It's unclear if she is only avoiding him, or if she has gone under the radar entirely. I have reached out to Klue myself to see if she responds, and if she is OK.

I saw the pictures of her at Portland. She looked fine, happy even, which makes this all the more strange. I reached out to a trusted friend who I knew was going to be there, and asked that she let Klue know that I am trying to get a hold her. She said she passed my message on, but still no contact.", "<br />", "<br />", "I'm starting to get worried, no longer because I think she's in any kind of danger, but because I just don't know what she's thinking, and why she's closed all channels of communication to me.", "<br />", "<br />"], :ignore=>true}}
