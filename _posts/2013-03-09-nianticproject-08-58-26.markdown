More information today about the DroneNet... an image captured in the field by an operative. The NIA has been watching the headcounts at the anomalies in anticipation of deployment.

In addition, news that a full scale model of the James Webb Telescope will be on display just minutes from the Austin, TX anomaly. Scientists will be making presentations as part of the exhibit, covering topics including 'Are we Alone?' and 'Unravelling Cosmic Mysteries.' Rumors are circulating that this is all connected, somehow.... ([http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/JWSTSXSW/](http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/JWSTSXSW/ ""))
