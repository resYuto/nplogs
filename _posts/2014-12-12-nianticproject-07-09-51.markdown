Continuing her coverage of the incredible achievements made by Ingress Agents, Susanna looks at how Anomalies have grown from small informal gatherings to massive logistical operations spread across thousands of Agents taking on multiple highly specialized roles. This growth has been assisted by agent-driven activities with great ambition, joining Agents across continents to undertake complex and challenging operations, such as Eureka, Matahari, Ursa Major and Green Marble.

Being a part of and witnessing acts like this has changed Agents and inspired them to change their communities, and they have begun to reach out and attempt to transform the world around them.

Agents, as we enter Year Three, continue to build your ranks, shape your communities and conduct great operations that inspire us all.
