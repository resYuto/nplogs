+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") prepares to move on, after a small village helps him recover from exposure.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>I’ll be leaving this village soon.<br /><br />I was pretty worn down with exposure when I got here, still need a few days to come back to strength. <br /><br />The people here have been unquestioningly hospitable and helpful. Their cuisine is excellent. Sparse, like the land itself, but rich with flavor and history. Their ability to use this land and climate to its fullest is earned through centuries of subsistence farming and hardship. The flavors: A whole different story. You would work out ancient trade routes through the cuisine itself; tracing back the movement of armies and merchants in both time and every cardinal direction.<br /><br />Perhaps one day I’ll write a piece on culinary archeology. Fascinating. I appreciate, by the way, the efforts that have gone to reassemble the ‘breadcrumbs’ I had left out there. I was able to track down a number of them after my recursion, but some remained.<br /><br />Each one helps. I will write more about the so-called 'Diodati Epiphany' tomorrow.  Heading out to watch a polo match now.<br /><br /></div>
