Here is the second piece of +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s opening statement at the initiation of the Niantic Project.

**Yesterday, we discussed who would align with whom at a personal level. Today I want to expand that conversation to the Corporate interests, particularly with regards to scientists. With Oliver Lynton-Wolfe either genuinely behind Jarvis, or feigning allegiance, who will the corporations turn to to further their development? ****+[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "")**** had previously made a commitment to research technology that would assist Enlightened Agents. How will they make good on this promise? Who outside the Niantic alumni might have that expertise, and if that answer is no-one, who will they attempt to acquire?** 

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
