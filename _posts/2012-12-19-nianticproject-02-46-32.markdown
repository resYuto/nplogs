Received the Hank Johnson script that was being discussed yesterday, interesting stuff. That's up here:Â [http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc118a](http://www.nianticproject.com/?id=sc118a "")

More interesting to me, however, was the photograph attached to this post. An agent in the field sent it to me, along with the accompanying cryptic message: 'Undiscovered so far.'

Not sure what that means... but I hope we find out soon.
