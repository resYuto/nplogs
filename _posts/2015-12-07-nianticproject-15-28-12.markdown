Ezekiel Calvin's fate lies at the heart of the [#Abaddon](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon "") Anomaly in Oakland.

+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") believes controlling him is critical to the Enlightenment in their struggle to suppress the influence of the N'zeer.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>It is no accident that the event next weekend in Oakland is happening where and when it is. I have to be there. There are questions that only Calvin can answer and it is imperative for the future of the Enlightenment that we control this man. The N’zeer must not have ultimate triumph. <br /><br />At this point, I have no doubt that Calvin had been plotting <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23Abaddon">#Abaddon</a> since before he hired me to study 13MAGNUS decades ago. I don’t know whether he was Anti-Magnus back then, or just a sensitive exploring the hidden world, but I now know that I unwittingly gave up too many 13MAGNUS secrets. <br /><br />I have to atone for that.  <br /><br />For the time being, it appears that I must trust Jahan. Yes. I know the dangers of this, but desperate times call for desperate measures.<br /><br /></div>
