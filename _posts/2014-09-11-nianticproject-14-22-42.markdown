In a recent video, Azmati was seen assisting in an operation to help treat +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 ""). The likely 'man-behind-the-curtain' for this operation was none other than Ezekiel Calvin.

It's unlikely that Azmati has any direct loyalty to Jarvis. He's always been somewhat independent, and the only real relationship we know he has is to +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 ""), but Hank's been missing for months. 

Why was Azmati helping Calvin? It had always been a mystery, but this document, dated late June 2014, may shed some light on what tied Azmati and Calvin together.

Difficult times makes for strange bedfellows.
