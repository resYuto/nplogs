+Thomas Greanias is back and answering more Q&amp;A and sharing some Activation and Asset codes right now at his Google+ page...

 [#alignment](https://plus.google.com/s/%23alignment "")   [#ingress](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ingress "")  <div class="shared"><br /><h2>Thomas Greanias</h2>OK I’m back! Thanks for all the great <a rel="nofollow" class="ot-hashtag" href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23alignment">#alignment</a> portal submissions, some really great ones... I’ll be going through those later today to pick one for my cover, so keep them coming.<br /><br />I’m going to kick off this Q&amp;A session with three questions, the first to answer gets either a one time passcode or Ingress Activation code, you pick, after that back to answering your questions...<br /><br /></div>
