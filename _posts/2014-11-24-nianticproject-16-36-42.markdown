+[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 "") shares his hopes: That someday our collective knowledge will render us, as a species, powerful enough to be heard and seen on the scale of the universe.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Martin Schubert</h2>A fantastic read. It's good to be reminded every now and again that our work stands on the shoulders of so many giants.<br /><br />Our all-consuming lives and research and trials may one day change the scale of human impact, from being an insignificant fleck in the universe, to a ripple, to a wave. <br /><br /></div>
