+[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 "")'s academic career crashes and burns, it's unlikely she'll be able to salvage a relationship with any university after receiving a letter like this. Academic circles are small and closely networked, and despite the mentions of 'NDAs' it's likely this information will spread, off the record and quickly.

She mentioned the private sector in her interview on the Ingress Report some weeks ago. Where might she be headed?
