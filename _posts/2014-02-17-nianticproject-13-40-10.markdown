Two of the wisest men in the world of +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") dive deep into history in an attempt to make sense of [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "").

The information in here is packed so densely that I've only just begun to make sense of what they are speaking about.

**It will require the assistance of the elite members of this Investigative Community to help the rest of parse the discoveries within this document. ****+[Operation Essex](https://plus.google.com/101577681173166935630 "")****, I'm looking at you. I also recall another conversation somewhere in the Niantic Archives that seems to connect to this. I'll have to dig a bit to locate it. What are Nagassa and Lightman getting at in their conversation? I'm doing all I can to obtain the rest of this asset.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, references and speculation.
