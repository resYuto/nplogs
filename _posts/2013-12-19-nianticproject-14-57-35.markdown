At the climax of  [#13MAGNUS](https://plus.google.com/s/%2313MAGNUS "") , a sequence of images and sound appeared in the Cupid's Span portal.

I have obtained that flow of information in full.

As with many of the previous Glyph messages we have intercepted and observed, the origin of this stream must be questioned, as well as its content...

**Is this a message from Jarvis? From the Shapers? What does it mean, as a whole, and also for our future?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful insights, speculation and references.
