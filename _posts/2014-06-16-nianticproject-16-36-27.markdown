After seeing yesterday's video, many of you expressed concern about the safety of the videographer and hoped to discover their identity.

I've spent most of today attempting to obtain this information.

Details are still scant, I have been unable to confirm the identity of the witness who captured this video, but from what I can tell, the person did survive. As may be expected, the videographer is currently experiencing some side-effects from the exposure and the concussion but there is no reason, at this point, for major concern.

I'll keep you updated as I learn more.
