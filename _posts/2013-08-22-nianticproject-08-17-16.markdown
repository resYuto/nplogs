The Resistance buckle down and capture Measurement 2 of Operation  [#Cassandra](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Cassandra "")  - São Paulo,

One Measurement remains, the Enlightened have a strong advantage from their dominance over Cluster 1, but the Resistance are rallying.

With many blocking Links, it would be difficult to create a field over Cluster 3 within the city limits. But coordinating with Agents outside the city to create a megafield may be an interesting proposition.<br /><br />Total for the Resistance this Anomaly = 54<br /><b>Total for the Enlightened this Anomaly = 108</b><br /><br /><b>Measurement 2 Details</b><br /><br />The Resistance owned 2 Volatile Portals and 3 Non-Volatile Portals.<br /><b>The Enlightened owned 2 Volatile Portals and 5 Non-Volatile Portals.</b><br /><br /><b>The Resistance had 4 Links standing at Measurement Time.</b><br /><br /><b>Total for the Resistance this Measurement = 31</b><br />Total for the Enlightened this Measurement = 25<br /><br /><b>Measurement Time Details</b><br /><br />Original:   FORTY      NINE     SECONDS    PAST   THE HOUR SHARP<br />Padded: XXFORTYXXXXXXNINEXXXXXSECONDSXXXXPASTXXXTHEXHOURXSHARPXXXXX<br />OTP Key: XWDRDRZYUIIGFQXZPLYPRVUAWIPRJOXEIWYQPLTEBJNJSEHXXSZZUXNTRZF<br />Encrypted String: UTIFUKXVRFFDCDFMTIVMOSMEYWCUBLUBFLYIIIQBUQRGZSBOUKGZLMKQOWC<br />MD5 of OTP Key: E63E9178C1DE5CDEF33487D05C5E07BD<br /><br /></div>
