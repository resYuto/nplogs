+[Felicia Hajra-Lee](https://plus.google.com/118344555717370644832 "") is at it again.

A letter from the author to +[Thomas Greanias](https://plus.google.com/102489350322422853902 "") came into my possession. Attached to it were two pages of some new material. Part of a new work that she claims will reveal the truth about the night that Corporate operatives stole into the beleaguered Niantic facility, releasing the remaining scientists from under HAZDATA/NIA control.

In addition, Felicia claims her visions of that moment in time reveal the truth behind the death of Victor Kureze, a long-open mystery, as well as what befell the indestructible, self-healing and altogether strange body of Roland Jarvis.

**Think back to Operation ****[#Voynich](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Voynich "")****. Under cover of the Anomaly, a number of forces collided, hoping all eyes would be looking elsewhere. While Carrie was attempting to escape Corporate operatives in Hamburg, a rogue squad of Agents from ****+[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "")****, as well as teams from ****+[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "")**** and ****+[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "")**** were each attempting to 'bag a prize,' so to speak, in Geneva. We know that the scientists were liberated, but what else? What do we know about what happened that night? What happened in the lead-up and the fallout? What are the missing pieces of information that this document may contain?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with their thoughtful insights, recollections, speculations and observations.
