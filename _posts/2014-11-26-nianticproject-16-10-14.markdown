After months of hiding and being hunted, Hank Johnson finds some long-needed respite.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>Got up and walked around in a garden today for the first time since arriving here. Still feeling light headed... confused. I've always been lucky, but this time, I feel like I was saved by an angel. She says her name is Jahan. She's a scientist, and I guess also a part time humanitarian worker and keeper of broken things. Her family owns this place where I am now. Parts of it seem old and crumbling, parts are newer. Back in its day, I'm sure it was nothing short of a princely estate or a palace of some kind. Being here is like a journey back in time.<br /><br />Perception hazy. I don’t know why. Jahan and her family's servants are mindfully nursing me back to health. I am fully aware that I am a simulacrum, but it feels remarkably like being human. Heightened awareness leads, in some cases, to heightened perception, which is similar to having too much data. Confusing. More later.<br /><br /></div>
