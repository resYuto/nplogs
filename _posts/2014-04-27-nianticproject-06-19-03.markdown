[#### photo: #Interitus 02 Measurement 2 Report
The Resistance Strikes Back. While the Enlightened seemed to be holding a position of strength in Colorado Springs, that advantage now stands decimated. Salt Lake City remains an even match, but without a major strategic push, that will not be good enough to undo the losses incurred earlier in the day and the Resistance megafield over Flagstaff, which has now withstood two Measurements.
At Measurement 2, the Resistance outperformed the Enlightened in this US vector of the #Interitus 02 Anomaly, Leading by 182 (602 to 420).
Overall across today’s Anomaly, the Resistance have increased their lead to 703. (1984 to 1281).
Agents across the globe and in their respective Regions may be able to help quell the tide. That remains to be seen.
