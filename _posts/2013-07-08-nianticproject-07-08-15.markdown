This NIA document, a series of communications about +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") intercepted from within the three XM Corporations, +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 ""), +[IQTech Research](https://plus.google.com/108020987035258478791 "") and +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 ""), reveals the beginnings of their machinations, as each attempts to leverage Operation [#Voynich](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Voynich "") in Hamburg to their own advantage. 

My question today takes us back to March. Prior to the takeover of the Niantic Facility by Hazdata during Operation [#ShaperData](https://plus.google.com/s/%23ShaperData ""), a leaked communication shone light on a supposed 'deal' between ADA and +[Misty Hannah](https://plus.google.com/104253779462149704457 "").

What do you speculate were the two sides of that deal?
