+[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports from Austin as the Factions collide in a fierce contest for the first Shōnin Anomalies, including the narrowest margin victory in Ingress history.

In a day marked by ambitious fielding and tireless ground efforts, over 6000 Agents rose to the challenge across Europe and the Americas, with more than 2000 in Florence and over 1300 in Austin at the largest US Anomaly to date.

In the wake of Enlightened victories over Florence and Austin, new intel emerged from a woman known only as The Acolyte. In the video that surfaced, the Acolyte claims that +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") has died, and that she now intends to carry the beacon of his message forward. The video also depicts what appears to be a massive, potentially catastrophic XM event at a 13MAGNUS Portal in the Afghan mountains. The Indian biotech researcher and Anti-Magnus leader, Jahan, was attempting to conduct a N'zeer summoning ritual using assistance from the Resistance, but it appears something went very wrong. Analysis of the footage seems to show former Niantic researcher, +[Devra Bogdanovich](https://plus.google.com/102598577258553073047 ""), disappearing in a flash of XM energy.

Footage has also emerged showing a clandestine meeting between +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") and +[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""). It appears that +[A Detection Algorithm](https://plus.google.com/114076692022231059864 "") has been keeping secrets, and the conspiracy at the heart of the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") may go deeper than was ever suspected.

The next Ingress First Saturday will take place in over 120 cities across the world on March 7th, and the Shōnin Finale Anomalies will take place on March 28th, in Tokyo, Hannover and Pasadena with Satellites in Adelaide, Christchurch, Guangzhou, Cardiff, Reykjavik, Yekaterinburg, Lima, Denver and Orlando.
