The first [#Helios](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Helios "") Anomalies approach, striking San Diego, Dublin and several other cities this weekend. +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") s headed to Comic-Con, the site of the first revelations about the Niantic Project, to investigate a new classified project called [#Endgame](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Endgame ""). 

Despite the controversy surrounding XM, Agents share their inspiration with images of [#IngressActualGameplayFootage](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressActualGameplayFootage "") and stories of their adventures, with Sitreps from Atlanta, South Africa and more.
