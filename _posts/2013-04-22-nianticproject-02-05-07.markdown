Victor Kureze Believed Dead
BREAKING

TransGlobal Press International Wire Service

GENEVA, Switzerland (TPI) – Following initial reports, a HAZDATA official has confirmed a corpse discovered at the Niantic Facility may be that of theoretical physicist Dr. Victor Kureze.

Cause of death has not yet been released. 'Let’s not get ahead of ourselves’ says spokesman. 'We will wait for a thorough investigation.'

Victor Kureze was the scientist most credited with discovering Exotic Matter (XM), and was one of the first scientific researchers to join the Niantic Project, according to leaked intelligence reports.

Kureze had spoken to the online news-source 'The Ingress Report' last week. Analysts speculate that he may have violated confidentiality agreements.
