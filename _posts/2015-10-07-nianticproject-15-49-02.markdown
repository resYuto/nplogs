Thanks to the timely actions of +[Keisha W.](https://plus.google.com/114260042183569524453 ""), the cryptic clue from yesterday was found to conceal a large dead drop near the Robert E. Howard house in Cross Plains, TX. Thank you for your excellent work, Agent. Gratitude is also due to those who helped decrypt this clue and pass it through the extensive network of Agents in order to assist in the recovery.

In additional to a number of other items, a letter was recovered, purportedly from Farnsworth Wright (the editor of Weird Tales) to Robert E. Howard. It discusses a story called 'Corpses of Abaddon.'

Coincidence?

Perhaps, but we must consider the possibility that this letter may in fact be real. We have seen evidence before that supported the idea that Robert E. Howard was a powerful creative and XM Sensitive.
