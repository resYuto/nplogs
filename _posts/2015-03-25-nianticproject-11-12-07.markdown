News broke earlier today of changes emerging within the +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 "") Scanner App.

In the lead-up to what might be the largest XM Anomaly to date, in Kyoto, Japan on Saturday March 28th, it appears that portions of the Ingress Scanner have begun to manifest in Japanese.

I suspect that this leaked +[Hulong Transglobal](https://plus.google.com/107849663787965375687 "") memo will shed more light on the source and nature of these changes, but I've only been able to translate it very roughly myself.

Any Investigators in the Japanese community? Your help is needed...
