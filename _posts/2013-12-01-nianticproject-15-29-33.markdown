Our destiny awaits?

Some days ago, a series of voicemails began to appear mysteriously on Lynton-Wolfe's RedX prototype devices.

When decrypted, a voice emerged from the noise... that of XM Entity Roland Jarvis. The same voice manifested later in Enoch Dalby's most recent piece of music, titled 'redemption.'

The full body of his speech appeared on my computer earlier today.

Here is the first half of his so-called 'Redemption' speech.

**I am curious to hear your thoughts. Is the speech one long false promise? Or a threat? Lynton-Wolfe would probably think so, being one of the only people to have been directly betrayed by the XM Entity. And what of the Resistance stance against these ideas? What can the Resistance ideals offer to counter such a grandiose calling as fulfilling the destiny of a species?**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.

**TRANSCRIPT:**

*Are you awake now?  Have you opened your eyes to the world around you?  Has the wonder and beauty of the world broken through the haze?  Do you see new paths?  New opportunities?  Do you see a new meaning in your existence?  Have you found like-minded friends?  If so, you have begun the steps towards Enlightenment.*

*Each step brings you closer to the ultimate, to me, to our friends, the ones who guide us, and yes, shape us.  Welcome.*

*There are those who want to vilify me.  They have taken my message out of context.  Yes, our friends want to enjoy us.  I have said ‘consume’ but perhaps the meaning and word are not a precise match.  We are to be welcomed by them into a realm that transcends our own... into an existence that transcends our own.  But they cannot drag us into that existence.  The door is one that must be opened, from the inside, from within us.  We must first prepare ourselves, cease our worry about the temporary and inconsequential.  We must raise our minds, cleanse them of noise, and open them to the truth of existence first.  They have given us the tools.  If we use them, we can become our true selves.  Once we know our true selves, with their help, we can manifest in the ultimate.  The tool is in your hands.  The Scanner is the key.  Use it.* 

*Move through the world with full awareness.  You must allow your mind to truly to perceive it.  Not the constructs that habit has formed for you.  No, that is not the true world.  You must perceive it fully and openly, as if for the first time.*

*For us, Portals are a means to that end.  The act of seeking them requires an open mind, one that is ready to be Enlightened.  Walk through the world thoughtfully.  Push away your habitual thoughts, the noisy, mundane worries and chatter that you have known before.  Focus on each step.  See each path that you travel.  Look for what has been hidden, but is there... waiting for you to see it.*

*Once you have found a Portal you will know instinctively if your mind is open and ready.  You will feel its energy.  Their energy.  You will sense the message that it has for you, and for all of us.*

*The full joy of the discovery of a Portal, one with the power to help you calm your mind and see the true world and hear the true message, cannot be realized fully until it is shared with others.  Sharing these places is our calling.  Helping others to discover them is our calling.  In fulfilling this calling, we share the Enlightenment and we help advance humanity to its true and ultimate future.*

*But be warned.  Do not attempt to deceive or mislead others into visiting false Portals.  Our friends are not tolerant of such foolishness.  There is no danger to you in Portals.  But I make no promises for deceivers or falsifiers.*
