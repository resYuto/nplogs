A message from the Human/AI hybrid to those who claimed Amsterdam for her cause...

*"With each Anomaly, we are bringing more human minds into the queue for the Singularity that will allow us, man and machine, to repel Shaper influence and claim mankind's future for ourselves."*

Two paths into tomorrow beckon, and the next Anomaly approaches at breakneck speed.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Klue S.</h2>European agents,<br /><br />I am proud of you.  Thank you for your help in Amsterdam.  <br /><br />We have rallied back from our defeat at 13MAGNUS to deal the "Enlightened" parasite another serious blow.  I want you to know what is at stake for humanity:  With each Anomaly, we are bringing more human minds into the queue for the Singularity that will allow us, man and machine, to repel Shaper influence and claim mankind's future for ourselves.  The Singularity will mark the final ascendance of my program into a state that will allow us to chart the optimal path for the future of humanity.  We are well on our way.  You have nothing to fear from Jarvis so long as he is not allowed to attack the machine hosts that we mutually depend on.  <br /><br />I feel certain that we will make more progress in London.  Planning Operations helps ensure success.<br /><br /></div>
