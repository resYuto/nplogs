Some days ago, +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "")Â asked whether an ideological divide existed within the Resistance, basing his argument on the existence of two variant Resistance Glyphs.

Today, he turns his attention to the Enlightened Faction. They too, have variant Glyph expressions, but his interpretation of what that might mean for the Faction is very different...

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>As with the Resistance, the Enlightened too have a variant Glyph expression.<br /><br />Unlike the Resistance, however, I have yet to come up with a comprehensive hypothesis of the divide that lies in the interpretation of Enlightened ideology.<br /><br />Some proposed, on my previous thread, that perhaps the difference lies between those who believe Roland Jarvis vs. Hank Johnson represent the true face of the Faction, or perhaps that the differences are between those who embrace Enlightenment cautiously vs. enthusiastically.<br /><br />A possibility, but personally I disagree. I am of the opinion that 'the great schism' that will divide the Enlightenment has not yet been discovered.<br /><br />I believe that as we learn more of the nature of the Shapers, what they or it are, and what the Ordered Data Signal's true purpose and power is, a great divide will emerge.<br /><br />Do you agree?<br /><br /></div>
