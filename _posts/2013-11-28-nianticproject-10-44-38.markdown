On the run, off the grid or gone forever? Susanna Moyer is missing.

A compromised intelligence report from +[Visur Technology](https://plus.google.com/115880454950193571355 "") suggests that the XM Corporation, and one must assume its competitors, have been keeping an eye on the enigmatic host of the Ingress Report.

Following a series of unauthorized injections into the Report's broadcast, the revelations emerged that Susanna Moyer had at one point been involved with the NIA. It's unclear as of now whether she remains under their control or if she went rogue when she created the Ingress Report.

What's clear is that she is a target, and now, it seems, a moving one.

Unable to contact Moyer, I reached out to one of her associates. I asked if they were OK, if the information was true, and whether they would be able to continue to produce the [#IngressReport](https://plus.google.com/s/%23IngressReport "") if the team had been forced to disappear into the shadows. The connection was terminated almost immediately, save for one brief reply: "Nothing can stop us." 

**The question we must now ask is: Has Susanna gone rogue, or has she been a rogue operator since the beginning? Why has she gone missing, and if she didn't go underground of her own volition, what has happened to her? Her associate promises that they can not be stopped. I'm certain the truth of that statement will emerge tomorrow, when, and if, the Ingress Report emerges for its weekly broadcast.**

A passcode to those who enrich our conversation with meaningful speculation, insights and references.
