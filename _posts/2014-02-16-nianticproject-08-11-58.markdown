The Resistance prevail at  [#Recursion](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Recursion "")  01 - Miami, Louisville and Columbus.

The first blow has been struck, but much remains on the road ahead. The first energized Portal will appear in Miami on Wednesday, capable of capturing Ancient Artifacts for Klue, ADA and the Resistance.

With the impact of Regional Tracking Data on Anomalies, Agents across the globe and through the week can and will shape the day with their efforts.

The next Anomaly is expected to strike Bangalore, Hyderabad and New Delhi a week from today.

I wish all Agents good luck.
