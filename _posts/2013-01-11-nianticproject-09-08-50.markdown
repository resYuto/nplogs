A sensitive in Paris send me an email this morning... She claims that she was drawn to a memorabilia shop near a portal in Montmartre some time yesterday, and discovered a tattered folder containing storyboards of the Devra and Jarvis escape from Niantic. She claims that we haven’t seen these ones before.

She said she left them for the rest of us as a gift, at the lizard king’s doorway to the other side.
