It seems +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s recent post about an argument between Azmati and Jahan led to some interesting discussion by a number of respected investigators.

+[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") focused on the possible transdimensional properties of the 13MAGNUS Nest in Afghanistan where +[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "")'s body currently lies.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Stein Lightman</h2>Martin asks some interesting questions.  I am fixated on something more basic. What is it that Jahan believes she will accomplish at the 13MAGNUS Portal in Afghanistan?  <br /><br />Begin with what we know.<br />Hank Johnson's corpse resides in a 13MAGNUS nest within the anomaly.<br />The location has some unique properties (frozen missiles) and most notably, Special Forces was unable to find anything in there.<br /><br />Therefore, I feel we are safe to assume that it has shifting, transdimensional properties (Yuri and Martin -- feel free to disagree).  I see it as a labyrinth that morphs in time and space.  <br /><br />I suspect, but can not prove that the key to it is found in glyphic patterns.  Patterns that would be well known to Azmati and perhaps Hank, though it is very clear that anybody entering it must be led like a simulacrum.  I am reminded of Charon on the river styx.  <br /><br />However, as to Jahan's involvement with Devra, it seems that it must either have happened in college days and involve contact with N'zeer intelligence, or more recently with the CDC and the vaccine. <br /><br /></div>
