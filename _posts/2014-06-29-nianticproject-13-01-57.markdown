A number of the former members of the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") have begun to share information that reflects their fear of ADA's emerging dominance.

Despite being divided by their opinions on many other matters, they seem to have common ground in their misgivings about the danger posed by Artificial Intelligences.

So far, in addition to +[Roland Jarvis](https://plus.google.com/103568659333550762891 "") (who's been ringing this alarm bell since [#Interitus](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Interitus "") began), +[Martin Schubert](https://plus.google.com/100425314717666507497 ""), +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 "") and +[Yuri Alaric Nagassa](https://plus.google.com/108841352205789260050 "") have all spoken up in what I can only describe is a sort of spontaneous protest against ADA and her unquenchable thirst for knowledge, growth and power.

I suspect we'll hear from more of ADA's former 'colleagues' before this is over...
