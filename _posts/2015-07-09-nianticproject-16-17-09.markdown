An Agent in San Diego recovered this earlier today at Comic-Con 2015.

No further details have emerged, but given the nature of this fragment, it seems that there may be more to learn in the days to come. 

As many of you may recall, the first revelations about the +[Niantic Project](https://plus.google.com/105211554081025512763 "") came to light when an  artist named +[Tycho C.](https://plus.google.com/106965960712090580437 "") interrupted a panel at Comic-Con 2012 and distributed images that he believed were visions of the future. 

Each of those images did ultimately shed light on the many secrets surrounding the Niantic Project and +[Ingress](https://plus.google.com/103320655754019011706 ""). Shortly after his outburst, Tycho was apprehended by government agents (possibly NIA), and has remained an elusive figure since.

Agents attending the [#MissionDay](https://plus.google.com/s/%23MissionDay "") on Sunday. Please keep me informed about anything you discover.
