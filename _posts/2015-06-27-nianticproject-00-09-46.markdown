From Utrecht, +[Susanna Moyer](https://plus.google.com/101560858827970533247 "") reports on one of the largest XM Anomalies in Ingress history.

In a day filled with twists and turns, the Enlightened and Resistance met across the world to determine the fate of the [#Persepolis](https://plus.google.com/s/%23Persepolis "") Anomalies, +[Stein Lightman](https://plus.google.com/115238965157544465033 ""), and Jahan's outreach to the N'zeer.

+[Klue S.](https://plus.google.com/110350977702120778591 ""), recently recovered from a traumatic separation with ADA, was present in Portland, although the Anomaly's effect on her is currently unknown.

A small section of a video has emerged containing a statement from Jahan about the Enlightened, the N’zeer, and humanity's road forward.

Over the weekend, two new XM Objects began to emerge within the Portal Network: the SoftBank Ultra Link and the MUFG Capsule.

In Portland, Agents on the ground took part in +[GORUCK](https://plus.google.com/107886514797510492384 "") spec-op training, and in Utrecht and Tohoku, Agents took part in officially organized Mission Days.

News has also surfaced that +[Tycho C.](https://plus.google.com/106965960712090580437 ""), the prescient comic book artist, may be about to release a new work. Agents can pre-order this new Graphic Novel at comic stores around the world. A source with recent intel about Tycho appeared on +[Behind The Scanner](https://plus.google.com/113020726391023655192 "") on Thurs, June 25.
