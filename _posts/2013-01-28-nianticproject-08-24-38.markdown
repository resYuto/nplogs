Braving rain, cold and darkness, Resistance and Enlightened agents gave their all to claim the heart of one man.

A siege was lain around the portal at the Visitor center, with Resistance agents sending XMPs forth like no tomorrow, but the Enlightened held their ground, and their resolve could not be weakened. Despite being surrounded by a massive blue field, the enlightened kept their keystone portal secure.

Not a decisive victory, but a victory nonetheless.

Agents in the field, your resolve and camaraderie inspire us all.
