+[Hank Johnson](https://plus.google.com/117792105926525258257 "") shares some of his beliefs about Portals and Power-spots and the relationships we form with them. The idea leads to why he left notes all around the globe for himself to find. Breadcrumbs now being discovered within the Portal Network by Agents.

x<div class="shared"><br /><h2>Hank Johnson</h2>It's come to my attention that some of the messages I left for myself before my recursion have begun to surface. <br /><br />When I left them, my purpose was to plant these ideas near portals that were important to my research.<br /><br />It's my belief that you leave bits of yourself, your being, at power-spots that you have visited. When you return, these bits are given back to you, and of course you leave another fresh part of you there. It's just a theory, but it has proven helpful to me. It's why some places feel special when you go there again and again.  <br /><br />After my recursion, I wandered for a good few months... I found some of these messages, left in a trail like breadcrumbs by a former me, but I suspect many more still exist in Portals around the world.  <br /><br />If you should discover one, please share it with me in the comments on my G+ page.<br /><br />Every new discovery fuels the process of reconstructing the memories/ideas my old self wanted me to have.<br /><br /></div>
